Please provide a brutally honest John Carmack-style critique of this React Native DL Scan project's implementation quality. Be uncompromising about simplicity, performance, and maintainability, but stay true to the project's reality and long-term vision.

Focus on:
1. **Simplicity**: Are we solving problems in the most straightforward way?
2. **Performance**: Are there obvious performance issues or bottlenecks?
3. **Maintainability**: Will a new developer understand this code in 6 months?
4. **Robustness**: How does the system handle edge cases and failures?
5. **Technical debt**: What shortcuts are we taking that will hurt us later?

Key observations I've gathered:
- Excellent use of DLParser-Swift to avoid custom AAMVA parsing
- Some architectural redundancy in scanning logic between hooks and components
- Placeholder quality checks in native code that aren't implemented
- Strong documentation and modular architecture
- Test coverage looks good but some iOS tests are placeholders
- Dual-mode scanning adds complexity but provides real value

Be thorough and go above and beyond in analysis - leave no stone unturned. Think like Carmack would: focus on fundamentals, call out any unnecessary complexity, and identify where the system might break under stress or scale.
