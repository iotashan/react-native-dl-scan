# M02 Sprint Plan - Front-side OCR Fallback

**Date:** 2025-06-21  
**Milestone:** M02 - Front-side OCR Fallback  
**Status:** Sprint plan created and ready for execution  
**Timeline:** Week 3 (3 sprints × ~1 week each)

## Executive Summary

M02 sprint planning is complete with 3 focused sprints designed to deliver front-side OCR scanning as a fallback when PDF417 barcode scanning fails. The plan builds systematically from OCR infrastructure through intelligent parsing to seamless integration.

## Sprint Overview

### 🚀 **S01: Vision Framework OCR Setup** (Week 1)
**Goal:** Establish core OCR infrastructure using iOS Vision Framework

**Key Deliverables:**
- VNRecognizeTextRequest configuration for optimal license text recognition
- Document detection pipeline with license boundary identification
- Quality assessment system (blur, brightness, contrast scoring)
- Text extraction pipeline with <2 second processing target

**Success Criteria:** Raw text successfully extracted from license images with quality scoring

---

### 🧠 **S02: Field Parsing Engine** (Week 2)  
**Goal:** Transform raw OCR text into structured license data

**Key Deliverables:**
- Heuristic parsing engine for field identification
- State-specific parsing rules for top 10 US states
- Confidence scoring system for extraction reliability
- Error correction for common OCR mistakes (0→O, 1→I)

**Success Criteria:** 80%+ field extraction accuracy with <500ms parsing time

---

### 🔄 **S03: Fallback Integration** (Week 3)
**Goal:** Seamless integration with existing M01 barcode scanning

**Key Deliverables:**
- Automatic fallback logic (barcode → OCR on failure)
- Enhanced useLicenseScanner hook with dual-mode support
- Timeout/retry mechanisms with user guidance
- Unified LicenseData format across scanning modes

**Success Criteria:** <4 second combined fallback processing with smooth UX

## Dependencies & Risk Mitigation

### ✅ **Resolved Dependencies**
- M01 completed foundation provides shared infrastructure
- React Native Vision Camera integration available
- iOS Vision Framework APIs accessible

### ⚠️ **Risk Areas & Mitigation**
- **OCR Accuracy:** Start with high-confidence states, progressive enhancement
- **Performance:** Neural Engine optimization, image preprocessing 
- **State Variations:** Begin with CA/TX patterns, expand systematically

## Performance Targets

| Component | Target | Sprint |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| OCR Processing | <2 seconds | S01 |
| Field Parsing | <500ms | S02 |
| Combined Fallback | <4 seconds | S03 |
| Field Accuracy | 80%+ | S02 |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Begin S01 - Vision Framework OCR Setup
2. **Sprint Planning:** Detailed task breakdown for S01
3. **Resource Allocation:** iOS Vision Framework expertise required
4. **Testing:** Prepare sample license dataset for validation

## Questions for Stakeholders

1. Priority order for state-specific parsing rules (recommend CA, TX, FL, NY first)?
2. Acceptable OCR accuracy threshold for production release?
3. Fallback timeout preferences (recommend 3-5 seconds for barcode attempt)?
