# Task: Fix Critical Test Infrastructure - Timer Cleanup and Memory Leaks

## Context

The project has reached a critical state with a test health score of 4/10, blocking sprint progression per established criteria (requires >6 to proceed). Current issues identified in the 2025-06-24 project review include:

- **Test Suite Status**: FAILING (216/285 tests)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 75.8% (216 passed, 69 failed)  
- **Test Health Score**: 4/10
- **Blocking Status**: BLOCKED - Health score blocks sprint progression

This is a critical blocker that must be resolved before any new feature development can continue. The issues are distinct from previous fixes (TX001, TX002) and focus specifically on timer race conditions and memory management in `FallbackController` and `IntelligentModeManager`.

## Description

Fix critical test infrastructure failures caused by timer cleanup race conditions and memory leaks in the FallbackController and IntelligentModeManager modules. These issues are causing force exit warnings, test timeouts, and async operation leaks that indicate serious production stability risks.

## Goal / Objectives

- Eliminate timer cleanup race conditions in FallbackController and IntelligentModeManager
- Fix memory leaks causing force exit warnings during test execution
- Restore test health score to >6 minimum (target >8 for stability)
- Achieve >85% test pass rate (target 240/285 tests passing)
- Ensure clean test exit without force termination warnings
- Stabilize test infrastructure for continued sprint progression

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Timer Management Race Conditions
**Files affected**:
- `src/utils/FallbackController.ts` - activeTimers Set management
- `src/utils/IntelligentModeManager.ts` - warningTimer and timeoutTimer cleanup
- `src/utils/__tests__/FallbackController.memory.test.ts` - failing timer cleanup tests
- `src/utils/__tests__/IntelligentModeManager.test.ts` - timeout management tests

**Issues**:
- NodeJS.Timeout management inconsistencies
- Race conditions between timer creation and cleanup
- AbortController implementation has timing issues  
- Timer cleanup not synchronized with test lifecycle

### 2. Memory Management Failures
**Files affected**:
- `src/utils/FallbackController.ts` - memory leak from unresolved promises
- `src/utils/IntelligentModeManager.ts` - resource cleanup on destroy()
- Test files showing force exit warnings

**Issues**:
- Unresolved promises persisting after test completion
- Event listener cleanup not comprehensive
- Timer references not properly cleared
- Memory leaks from overlapping state management systems

### 3. Date/Time Handling Bugs
**Files affected**:
- Test files with timezone-sensitive failures
- `src/utils/formatters.test.ts` - calculateAge function errors

**Issues**:
- Timezone handling inconsistencies across test environments
- Date calculation errors in different locales
- Test environment date mocking conflicts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test health score reaches >6 minimum (target >8)
- [ ] Test pass rate achieves >85% (target 240+ of 285 tests)
- [ ] No force exit warnings during test execution
- [ ] All timer cleanup race conditions resolved
- [ ] Memory leaks eliminated (verified with Jest --detectLeaks)
- [ ] FallbackController.memory.test.ts passes completely
- [ ] IntelligentModeManager timer tests pass without timeouts
- [ ] Date/timezone handling standardized with UTC approach
- [ ] No regression in existing passing tests
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline shows green status

## Dependencies

- **Architecture**: Follows patterns in `/Users/shan/dev/iotashan/react-native-dl-scan/.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Project State**: References `/Users/shan/dev/iotashan/react-native-dl-scan/.simone/10_STATE_OF_PROJECT/2025-06-24-17-41-critical-issues.md`
- **Sprint Progression**: Unblocks S07 Advanced Features continuation
- **Milestone**: Critical for M04 Dual-Mode UI Integration completion

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points

1. **FallbackController Timer Management** (`src/utils/FallbackController.ts`):
   - `activeTimers: Set<NodeJS.Timeout>` for tracking (line 45)
   - `destroy()` method for cleanup
   - AbortController integration with timer lifecycle
   - Integration with IntelligentModeManager timer systems

2. **IntelligentModeManager Timer System** (`src/utils/IntelligentModeManager.ts`):
   - `warningTimer?: NodeJS.Timeout` (line 26)
   - `timeoutTimer?: NodeJS.Timeout` (line 27)
   - `destroy()` method for resource cleanup
   - Timer coordination with state transitions

3. **Test Infrastructure Patterns**:
   - Jest fake timers usage in test suites
   - `afterEach()` cleanup blocks for timer management
   - Memory leak detection with Jest --detectLeaks flag
   - Mock strategy for timer-dependent operations

### Existing Patterns to Follow

1. **Successful Timer Patterns** in `src/utils/__tests__/logger.test.ts`:
   - Proper jest.clearAllTimers() usage
   - Consistent timer lifecycle management
   - Clean test isolation

2. **Memory Management Patterns** in existing passing tests:
   - Resource cleanup in afterEach blocks
   - Proper mock reset strategies
   - AbortController usage patterns

3. **Date Handling Patterns**:
   - UTC-based date calculations
   - Environment-agnostic date testing
   - Consistent timezone handling

### Implementation Notes

1. **Timer Race Condition Resolution**:
   - Implement proper timer cleanup synchronization
   - Use consistent pattern for timer tracking across modules
   - Ensure AbortController properly cancels associated timers
   - Add timer lifecycle logging for debugging

2. **Memory Leak Elimination**:
   - Implement comprehensive cleanup in destroy() methods
   - Add event listener removal in component cleanup
   - Ensure all promises are properly resolved or rejected
   - Add memory monitoring in critical test paths

3. **Test Infrastructure Stabilization**:
   - Standardize jest timer configuration across test files
   - Implement consistent afterEach cleanup patterns
   - Add memory leak detection to critical test suites
   - Ensure proper mock isolation between tests

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Maintain <200ms transition time requirements
   - Keep overall fallback time under 4 seconds
   - No degradation in test execution speed
   - Monitor memory usage during extended test runs
