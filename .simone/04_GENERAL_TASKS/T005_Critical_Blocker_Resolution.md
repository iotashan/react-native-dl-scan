# General Task T005: Critical Blocker Resolution

## Task Summary
Resolve critical development blockers identified in 2025-06-25 project review that are preventing milestone completion and sprint progression.

## Problem Statement
Project review revealed four critical blockers:
1. **Test Infrastructure Failure**: 62% pass rate (142/377 tests failing) blocking reliable development
2. **Sprint Status Misalignment**: S07 claims 100% completion but actually 50% complete (missing animations + accessibility)
3. **Over-Engineering Debt**: 978-line FallbackController and premature performance monitoring creating maintenance burden
4. **Git Workflow Violations**: Tracked files violating .gitignore, temporary files in root directory

**Impact**: Development velocity severely impacted, milestone completion blocked, unreliable project tracking.

## Success Criteria
- **Test Infrastructure**: >90% pass rate (from current 62%)
- **Architecture**: FallbackController reduced to <300 lines with 4 extracted focused classes
- **Process**: Accurate sprint tracking, clean git workflow
- **Overall**: Development velocity restored, all blockers removed

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Deliverable**: Updated documentation, enhanced development process

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Prerequisites
- Access to full codebase and test suite
- Ability to make architectural changes
- Time allocation for intensive development week

### Dependencies
- Git cleanup has no dependencies (start immediately)
- Test infrastructure work depends on baseline analysis
- Architecture changes can proceed in parallel with test fixes
- Final validation depends on completion of both streams

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Cannot break existing functionality
- Changes must be incremental and well-tested
- Need to validate each phase before proceeding

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk: Test failures reveal fundamental architectural issues
- **Mitigation**: Begin with comprehensive baseline analysis
- **Response**: Prioritize architectural fixes if issues are structural

### Medium Risk: Refactoring introduces new bugs or regressions
- **Mitigation**: Maintain test coverage during refactoring, parallel validation
- **Response**: Rollback plan available, checkpoint validations

### Low Risk: Timeline pressure leads to incomplete fixes
- **Mitigation**: Daily checkpoint reviews, adjust scope if needed
- **Response**: Ensure core blockers resolved even if optimizations deferred

## Checkpoint Schedule

### Day 1 Checkpoint
- [ ] Foundation complete (git clean, accurate status, test baseline)
- [ ] Decision point: Proceed with parallel streams

### Day 3 Checkpoint  
- [ ] Test improvements measurable (>75% pass rate target)
- [ ] Architecture extraction begun (timeout manager extracted)
- [ ] Decision point: Continue parallel work or focus on critical path

### Day 5 Checkpoint
- [ ] Major architectural components complete
- [ ] Integration testing started
- [ ] Decision point: Ready for final validation phase

### Day 6 Completion
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Blockers resolved
- [ ] System validated and documented

## Acceptance Criteria

### Quantitative Targets
- [ ] Test pass rate >90% (current: 62%)
- [ ] FallbackController <300 lines (current: 978)
- [ ] 4 focused classes with clear responsibilities
- [ ] Sprint status reflects actual completion

### Qualitative Outcomes
- [ ] Reliable test suite enables confident development
- [ ] Simplified architecture reduces cognitive load  
- [ ] Accurate tracking restores planning reliability
- [ ] Reduced technical debt for sustainable growth

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate (Post-Completion)

- [ ] Establish regular test health monitoring

### Long-term Process Improvements
