# General Task T006: Emergency Stabilization - Test Infrastructure Recovery and Architecture Integration Completion

## Description

Emergency recovery task to stabilize the project after T005 failures exposed critical architectural and test infrastructure issues. The project is currently in a degraded state with ~40% test pass rate (down from 62.6%) and incomplete FallbackController integration causing widespread failures. This task focuses on immediate stabilization and establishing sustainable development patterns.

## Context

Following T005 Critical Blocker Resolution attempt, the project experienced catastrophic test failures:
- Test pass rate dropped from 62.6% to ~40% 
- FallbackController refactoring created integration breaks
- Mock layer and bridge communication completely non-functional
- Development velocity at standstill

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Over-ambitious refactoring without incremental validation
2. Mock infrastructure not updated to match new architecture
3. Missing integration layer between new components
4. No rollback strategy when issues emerged

## Goal / Objectives

1. **Immediate Recovery**: Restore test infrastructure to minimum 62.6% pass rate
2. **Complete Integration**: Properly integrate FallbackController refactoring
3. **Establish Process**: Create incremental refactoring approach with validation gates
4. **Prevent Recurrence**: Implement safeguards against similar failures

## Acceptance Criteria

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- `src/utils/FallbackController.ts` → Coordination layer
- `src/utils/ScanController.ts` → Core scanning logic
- `src/utils/ScanTimeoutManager.ts` → Timeout handling
- `src/utils/QualityMetricsProcessor.ts` → Quality assessment
- `src/utils/StateTransitionManager.ts` → Mode switching

### Critical Files to Modify
1. **Mock Configuration**:
   - `__mocks__/react-native-vision-camera.js`
   - `__mocks__/src/NativeDlScan.js`
   - `jest.setup.js`

2. **Integration Points**:
   - `src/hooks/useLicenseScanner.ts`
   - `src/frameProcessors/scanLicense.ts`
   - `src/components/CameraScanner.tsx`

3. **Test Suites**:
   - `src/__tests__/bridge-communication-integration.test.ts`
   - `src/__tests__/frame-processor-integration.test.ts`
   - `src/utils/__tests__/FallbackController.test.ts`

### Testing Patterns to Follow
- Use existing patterns from `src/components/__tests__/`
- Follow mock patterns from working tests
- Leverage test utilities in `src/test-utils/`

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Further degradation during fixes
- **Mitigation**: Create git branch for each phase
- **Validation**: Run tests after each change
- **Rollback**: Keep restoration points

### Medium Risk: Time pressure leading to shortcuts
- **Mitigation**: Focus on stability over features
- **Response**: Defer non-critical improvements

### Low Risk: Missing edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing
- **Response**: Add to test suite incrementally
