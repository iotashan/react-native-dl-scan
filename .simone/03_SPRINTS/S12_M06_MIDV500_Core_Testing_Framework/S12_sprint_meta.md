# Sprint: Sprint 12 - Core Testing Framework Implementation (S12)

## Sprint Goal
Implement core testing framework that can feed MIDV-500 frames to existing scanning pipeline and validate results against ground truth data.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Create test harness for feeding extracted frames to scanning pipeline
- Implement ground truth comparison logic for text fields and document boundaries
- Build framework for mocking camera input with MIDV-500 frames
- Create basic result validation and reporting
- Integrate with existing React Native scanning components
- Implement support for 5 shooting conditions (table, keyboard, hand, partial, clutter)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Test harness can process MIDV-500 frames through existing scanning pipeline
- Ground truth comparison working for text extraction and boundary detection
- Camera API mocking functional with react-native-vision-camera
- Basic test reporting system implemented
- Framework can handle all 5 shooting conditions from dataset
- Unit tests for core testing framework components
- Documentation for test framework usage and extension

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint creates the core infrastructure for automated validation
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S11 (Environment Setup must be completed)
- Focus on robust integration with existing scanning pipeline without breaking current functionality
