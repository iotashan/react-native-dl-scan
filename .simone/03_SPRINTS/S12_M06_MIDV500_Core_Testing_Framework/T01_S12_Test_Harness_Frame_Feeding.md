# Task: Test Harness Frame Feeding System

## Description
Implement core test harness that can feed extracted MIDV-500 frames to the existing scanning pipeline, replacing live camera input with pre-processed frames for automated testing. This system bridges the gap between static test data and real-time scanning functionality.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create test harness to inject MIDV-500 frames into existing scanning pipeline
- Replace live camera input with controlled test frame sequences
- Maintain compatibility with existing React Native Vision Camera integration
- Support frame timing and sequence control for realistic testing scenarios
- Enable automated testing without physical device camera requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test harness successfully feeds MIDV-500 frames to existing scanning pipeline
- [ ] Frame injection compatible with React Native Vision Camera frame processor architecture
- [ ] Timing control implemented for realistic frame sequence simulation
- [ ] Support for different frame rates and sequence patterns
- [ ] Integration with existing PDF417 and OCR scanning components
- [ ] Error handling for frame loading and injection failures
- [ ] Performance optimization for automated testing efficiency
- [ ] Unit tests covering frame harness functionality

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze existing React Native Vision Camera frame processor integration
- [ ] Design frame injection architecture compatible with JSI frame processing
- [ ] Implement frame loading system for MIDV-500 extracted frames
- [ ] Create frame sequence controller with timing and rate management
- [ ] Integrate with existing scanning pipeline (PDF417 + OCR) without modification
- [ ] Add frame format conversion and preprocessing as needed
- [ ] Implement error handling for missing or corrupted frame files
- [ ] Create configuration system for different testing scenarios
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and optimization for batch testing
- [ ] Implement frame caching and memory management for large test sets
- [ ] Write unit tests for frame harness components
- [ ] Document frame harness API and usage patterns

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- React Native Vision Camera JSI frame processor architecture compatibility
- Integration with existing `scanLicense.ts` frame processor implementation
- Compatibility with current PDF417 and OCR scanning pipeline from M02-M03
- Frame format alignment with native iOS CVPixelBuffer expectations

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Frame processor plugin architecture from `ios/LicenseScanner/FrameProcessor/`
- JSI worklet patterns from existing `frameProcessors/scanLicense.ts`
- Error handling approaches from `hooks/useErrorHandler.ts`
- Performance optimization patterns from existing real-time scanning

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use React Native Vision Camera mock patterns for frame injection
- Implement frame-by-frame processing with configurable timing
- Maintain existing scanning pipeline architecture without modifications
- Design for both unit testing and integration testing requirements
- Create clear separation between test harness and production scanning code

**Technical Architecture:**
```
TestHarness
├── FrameLoader     # Load MIDV-500 frames from storage
├── SequenceController  # Manage frame timing and sequence
├── FrameInjector   # Inject frames into scanning pipeline
└── ResultCapture   # Capture scanning results for validation
```

**Frame Processing Requirements:**
- Frame format: CVPixelBuffer compatible with iOS Vision framework
- Resolution support: Variable resolutions from MIDV-500 dataset
- Timing control: Configurable frame rates (1-30 FPS)
- Memory management: Efficient handling of large frame sequences

**Performance Considerations:**
- Memory-efficient frame loading and caching
- Parallel test execution capability
- Resource cleanup for long-running test suites
- Optimization for CI/CD environment constraints
