# Task: Framework Testing Documentation

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation for the core testing framework, including usage guides, API references, and best practices for automated testing with MIDV-500 dataset. This documentation enables team adoption and ensures consistent testing practices.

## Goal / Objectives
- Document complete testing framework architecture and components
- Provide usage guides for different testing scenarios and workflows
- Create API reference documentation for framework integration
- Establish testing best practices and guidelines for team consistency
- Enable efficient onboarding for new team members using the testing framework

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete framework architecture documentation with component descriptions
- [ ] Usage guides covering common testing scenarios and workflows
- [ ] API reference documentation for all framework components and interfaces
- [ ] Best practices guide for effective testing with MIDV-500 dataset
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues and solutions
- [ ] Integration examples for different testing use cases
- [ ] Performance optimization guide for efficient testing execution
- [ ] Team onboarding documentation for new testing framework users

## Subtasks
- [ ] Document testing framework architecture and component relationships
- [ ] Create usage guide for basic testing scenarios and common workflows
- [ ] Document test harness API and configuration options from T01
- [ ] Provide camera mocking setup and configuration guide from T02
- [ ] Document ground truth comparison API and validation options from T03
- [ ] Create React Native integration guide and best practices from T04
- [ ] Document shooting condition testing strategies from T05
- [ ] Provide result validation and reporting usage guide from T06
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common testing issues and solutions

- [ ] Create API reference for all framework components and interfaces
- [ ] Provide team onboarding guide and testing framework introduction

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Documentation format consistency with existing project documentation standards
- Usage guide alignment with S13 framework integration requirements
- API reference preparation for S14 automated testing suite development
- Best practices establishment for S15 CI/CD integration implementation

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Documentation structure from existing project `docs/` directory
- API reference format from current native module documentation
- Usage guide patterns from existing React Native component documentation
- Best practices format from current development guidelines

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use clear, practical examples for complex testing scenarios
- Provide both quick-start and comprehensive documentation options
- Create modular documentation for different user roles and experience levels
- Include visual diagrams and flowcharts for complex processes
- Plan for documentation maintenance and version control
