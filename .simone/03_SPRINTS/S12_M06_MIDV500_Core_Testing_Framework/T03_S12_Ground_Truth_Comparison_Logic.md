# Task: Ground Truth Comparison Logic

## Description
Implement comprehensive comparison logic to validate scanning results against MIDV-500 ground truth data, including text field accuracy, document boundary detection, and confidence scoring. This system provides automated validation of scanning pipeline performance.

## Goal / Objectives
- Compare scanning results against MIDV-500 ground truth data for accuracy validation
- Implement text field comparison with fuzzy matching and normalization
- Validate document boundary detection using quadrangle coordinate comparison
- Calculate accuracy scores and confidence metrics for scanning performance
- Support different comparison modes for various validation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Text field comparison implemented with fuzzy matching and normalization
- [ ] Document boundary validation using quadrangle coordinate comparison
- [ ] Accuracy scoring system with configurable thresholds and metrics
- [ ] Support for partial matches and confidence-based validation
- [ ] Detailed comparison reporting with specific field-level accuracy
- [ ] Performance optimization for batch comparison operations
- [ ] Error handling for malformed results or missing ground truth data
- [ ] Unit tests covering all comparison logic and edge cases

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement text field comparison with string normalization and fuzzy matching
- [ ] Create document boundary comparison using quadrangle coordinate validation
- [ ] Develop accuracy scoring algorithms with configurable metrics
- [ ] Add confidence score integration for result quality assessment
- [ ] Implement partial match handling for incomplete or poor-quality results
- [ ] Create detailed comparison reporting with field-level breakdown
- [ ] Add support for different comparison modes (strict, fuzzy, confidence-based)
- [ ] Implement batch comparison for multiple test results
- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases and data quality issues
- [ ] Create performance optimization for large-scale validation
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for comparison logic
- [ ] Document comparison algorithms and configuration options

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Input format compatibility with existing scanning pipeline output
- Ground truth data integration with S11 T03 JSON parser output
- Result format alignment with T04 reporting system requirements
- Performance requirements for S13 full dataset validation

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Text comparison approaches from existing AAMVA validation logic
- Accuracy calculation patterns from current scanning result validation
- Fuzzy matching algorithms suitable for license field comparison
- Error handling patterns from existing result processing

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use industry-standard string distance algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler)
- Implement field-specific comparison rules (dates, names, addresses)
- Create configurable comparison thresholds for different accuracy requirements
- Design for both real-time and batch comparison scenarios
- Plan for extensibility to support additional document types

**Comparison Algorithm Types:**
- Exact match: Strict string equality for critical fields
- Fuzzy match: String distance algorithms for OCR error tolerance
- Semantic match: Field-specific validation (date formats, name variations)
- Confidence-weighted: Accuracy adjusted by scanning confidence scores

**Text Normalization:**
- Case normalization: uppercase/lowercase standardization
- Whitespace handling: consistent spacing and formatting
- Special character processing: punctuation and accent handling
- OCR error patterns: common substitution and transposition corrections

**Boundary Comparison:**
- Quadrangle coordinate distance calculation
- Perspective correction for angle and skew variations
- Area overlap percentage for boundary accuracy assessment
- Corner point precision validation with configurable tolerances

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- Field-level accuracy: percentage of correctly extracted fields
- Character-level accuracy: edit distance for text fields
- Boundary accuracy: overlap percentage and corner point precision
- Overall confidence: weighted average of all accuracy metrics
