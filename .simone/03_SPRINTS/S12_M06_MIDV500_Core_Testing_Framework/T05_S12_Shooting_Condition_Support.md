## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Condition metadata integration with S11 T03 ground truth parser
- Result validation compatibility with T03 comparison logic
- Performance analysis integration with T06 reporting system
- Testing scenario configuration with T01 test harness

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Condition handling patterns from existing image processing workflows
- Performance analysis approaches from current scanning optimization
- Edge case handling strategies from existing error recovery systems
- Reporting patterns from current scanning result analysis

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create condition-specific validation criteria based on realistic expectations
- Implement adaptive accuracy thresholds for challenging conditions
- Design comprehensive test coverage ensuring representative sampling
- Plan for condition-specific optimization recommendations
- Consider user experience implications for different environmental scenarios

**Shooting Condition Characteristics:**
- **Table**: Stable, controlled environment with good lighting
- **Keyboard**: Desktop environment with potential keyboard interference
- **Hand**: Handheld scanning with natural hand movement and angle variation
- **Partial**: Partial document occlusion or cropping challenges
- **Clutter**: Background clutter and visual interference

**Condition-Specific Testing:**
- Accuracy thresholds: Adjusted expectations for challenging conditions
- Performance benchmarks: Condition-appropriate timing and resource usage
- Error patterns: Condition-specific failure modes and recovery strategies
- User experience: Guidance and feedback appropriate for each condition

**Validation Strategies:**
- Table/Keyboard: High accuracy expectations, fast processing
- Hand: Moderate accuracy with angle and stability tolerance
- Partial: Reduced accuracy expectations, robust error handling
- Clutter: Focus on boundary detection and noise filtering

**Performance Analysis:**
- Condition-specific accuracy trends and patterns
- Processing time variations across conditions
- Memory and resource usage differences
- Error rate analysis and failure mode identification
