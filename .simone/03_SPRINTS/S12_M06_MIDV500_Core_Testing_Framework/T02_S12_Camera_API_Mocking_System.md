# Task: Camera API Mocking System

## Description
Implement comprehensive camera API mocking system for react-native-vision-camera to enable automated testing without physical camera hardware. This system provides controlled camera behavior simulation for consistent and reliable testing environments.

## Goal / Objectives
- Mock react-native-vision-camera API for automated testing environments
- Provide controlled camera behavior simulation for consistent test results
- Enable testing in CI/CD environments without camera hardware
- Support different camera states and error conditions for comprehensive testing
- Maintain compatibility with existing camera permission and lifecycle management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete react-native-vision-camera API mocking implemented
- [ ] Camera state simulation (active, inactive, error states) working
- [ ] Permission mocking for different authorization scenarios
- [ ] Frame delivery simulation compatible with existing frame processors
- [ ] Error condition simulation for robust error handling testing
- [ ] Configuration options for different testing scenarios and device types
- [ ] Integration with Jest testing framework and React Native testing utilities
- [ ] Performance optimization for automated test suite execution

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze react-native-vision-camera API surface and integration points
- [ ] Create comprehensive mock implementation for Camera component
- [ ] Implement useCameraDevice hook mocking with device simulation
- [ ] Mock camera permission states and authorization flows
- [ ] Create useFrameProcessor mock with frame delivery simulation
- [ ] Implement camera lifecycle mocking (start, stop, error recovery)
- [ ] Add device format and capability mocking for different test scenarios
- [ ] Create camera error simulation for error handling validation
- [ ] Integrate mocking system with Jest and React Native testing environment
- [ ] Add configuration options for different testing scenarios
- [ ] Implement mock performance optimization for test execution speed
- [ ] Document camera mocking usage patterns and configuration options

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Integration with T01 test harness frame feeding system
- Compatibility with existing camera integration in `components/CameraScanner.tsx`
- Mock setup alignment with current `__tests__/` testing infrastructure
- Configuration integration with T03 ground truth comparison requirements

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Mock implementation patterns from `__mocks__/react-native-vision-camera.js`
- Jest testing setup from existing `jest.config.js` and test files
- Error handling simulation from current `hooks/useErrorHandler.ts` testing
- Component testing patterns from existing React Native component tests

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create comprehensive mocks covering all used react-native-vision-camera APIs
- Implement realistic camera behavior simulation for accurate testing
- Design configurable mock behavior for different test scenarios
- Ensure mock performance doesn't slow down test execution significantly
- Plan for easy mock configuration updates as camera integration evolves

**Mock Architecture:**
```
CameraMocking
├── CameraComponentMock    # Mock Camera component
├── DeviceHookMock        # Mock useCameraDevice hook
├── FrameProcessorMock    # Mock useFrameProcessor hook
├── PermissionMock        # Mock permission management
└── ConfigurationManager  # Test scenario configuration
```

**Camera State Simulation:**
- Device availability: Mock different camera device types and availability
- Permission states: granted, denied, not-determined, restricted
- Camera lifecycle: initialization, active streaming, error states, cleanup
- Frame delivery: Controlled frame timing and format simulation

**Error Condition Testing:**
- Camera initialization failures
- Permission denied scenarios
- Device unavailable conditions
- Frame processor execution errors
- Memory and resource constraint simulation

**Configuration Options:**
- Mock camera device types (back, front, external)
- Permission state presets for different test scenarios
- Frame delivery timing and error injection
- Performance optimization settings for test execution
