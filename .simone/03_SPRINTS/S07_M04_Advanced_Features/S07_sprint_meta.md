# Sprint S07: Advanced Features & Polish

## Sprint Goal
Implement intelligent mode management, real-time quality indicators, animations, and comprehensive accessibility support to create a polished, production-ready scanning experience.

## Deliverables
1. Intelligent auto-mode with timeout-based fallback
2. Real-time quality indicators (blur, lighting, positioning)
3. Success animations and error recovery flows
4. Full accessibility implementation (VoiceOver, high contrast)
5. Smart guidance messages and user feedback

## Dependencies
- S06 completion (Core UI components)
- Camera and mode selector functionality
- Basic scanning flow established

## Tasks
- [x] T01_S07 - Intelligent Mode Management (COMPLETED)
- [x] T02_S07 - Quality Indicators & Feedback (COMPLETED)
- [ ] T03_S07 - Animations & Transitions (INCOMPLETE - all acceptance criteria unchecked)
- [ ] T04_S07 - Accessibility Implementation (INCOMPLETE - all acceptance criteria unchecked)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Auto mode switches from barcode to OCR after 10s timeout
- Quality indicators update in real-time (<100ms latency)
- Smooth transitions between modes and states
- Full VoiceOver support with meaningful descriptions
- Color-blind friendly UI elements

## Architecture Decisions
- TBD - Will be linked after ADR creation

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Complex state management for mode switching
  - **Mitigation:** Use state machines for predictable transitions
- **Risk:** Performance impact of real-time quality assessment
  - **Mitigation:** Implement throttling and frame skipping as needed

## Notes
- Focus on user experience and accessibility
- Ensure all animations respect reduced motion preferences
- Test with actual users for feedback on guidance messages
