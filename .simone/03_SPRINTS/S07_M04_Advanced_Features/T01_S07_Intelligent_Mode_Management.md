# T01_S07: Intelligent Mode Management

## Context
**Sprint**: S07 - M04 Advanced Features  
**Module**: M04 - Dual-Mode UI Integration  
**Previous Sprint**: S06 - Core UI Components  

## Dependencies
- S05.T01: Automatic Fallback Logic (established patterns)
- S06.T02: Mode Selector Implementation (UI components)
- S02.TX03: Error Handling and Quality Checks (quality metrics)

## Description
Implement intelligent auto-mode management with timeout-based fallback and quality-driven switching between PDF417 scanning and OCR modes. The system should provide a seamless user experience by automatically selecting the optimal scanning method based on conditions and performance.

## Technical Specifications

### 1. State Machine Design
```typescript
enum ScanMode {
  AUTO = 'auto',
  PDF417 = 'pdf417', 
  OCR = 'ocr'
}

enum AutoModeState {
  INITIAL_PDF417 = 'initial_pdf417',
  PDF417_TIMEOUT_WARNING = 'pdf417_timeout_warning',
  SWITCHING_TO_OCR = 'switching_to_ocr',
  OCR_ACTIVE = 'ocr_active',
  SUCCESS = 'success'
}

interface AutoModeConfig {
  pdf417TimeoutMs: number; // Default: 10000
  warningThresholdMs: number; // Default: 7000
  minQualityScore: number; // 0-1, default: 0.7
  switchDelayMs: number; // Smooth transition, default: 500
}
```

### 2. Timeout Logic Implementation
- Progressive timeout tracking with warning states
- Configurable thresholds for different use cases
- Smooth transitions between modes
- User notification before automatic switching

### 3. Quality-Based Switching
```typescript
interface QualityMetrics {
  brightness: number; // 0-1
  blur: number; // 0-1, lower is better
  glare: number; // 0-1, lower is better
  documentAlignment: number; // 0-1
}

// Switch to OCR if quality consistently low
const shouldSwitchToOCR = (metrics: QualityMetrics[]): boolean => {
  const recentMetrics = metrics.slice(-5); // Last 5 frames
  const avgQuality = calculateAverageQuality(recentMetrics);
  return avgQuality < config.minQualityScore;
};
```

### 4. Integration Points
- Hook into existing `useDLScanner` for seamless integration
- Leverage frame processor quality metrics from S02.TX03
- Update mode selector UI from S06.T02 with auto-mode indicator
- Maintain compatibility with manual mode selection

### 5. User Experience Considerations
- Subtle UI hints when in auto-mode
- Clear indication of active scanning method
- Smooth visual transitions between modes
- Option to override automatic decisions

[2025-06-24 17:15]: ✅ Task completed successfully - All requirements implemented and code review passed with zero issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Auto-mode correctly starts with PDF417 scanning
- [x] Timeout triggers smooth transition to OCR mode
- [x] Quality metrics influence mode switching decisions
- [x] Manual mode selection overrides auto-mode
- [x] Transitions are smooth and well-communicated

## Technical Notes
- Use React Native's `InteractionManager` for smooth transitions
- Implement debouncing for quality-based switching to avoid flickering
- Consider using `react-native-reanimated` for transition animations
- Ensure mode switching doesn't interrupt ongoing scans

## Complexity Assessment
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- State machine logic requires careful design
- Integration with multiple existing systems
- Balancing automation with user control
- Performance considerations for real-time decisions
