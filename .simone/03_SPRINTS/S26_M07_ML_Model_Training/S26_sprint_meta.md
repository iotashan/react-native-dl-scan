# Sprint: Sprint 26 - Advanced ML Model Training and Optimization (S26)

## Sprint Goal
Train production-ready ML models, implement continuous learning infrastructure, and optimize for edge deployment on mobile devices.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Train ensemble models combining multiple fraud detection approaches
- Implement transfer learning from IDNet to real-world documents
- Create model update mechanism for continuous improvement
- Optimize models for edge deployment (quantization, pruning)
- Implement federated learning capability for privacy-safe updates
- Build A/B testing framework for model versions
- Create model performance monitoring system

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Ensemble models achieving >97% accuracy on combined test sets
- Transfer learning demonstrating >90% accuracy on real documents
- Model update system operational with versioning control
- Optimized models <30MB with <100ms inference time
- Federated learning prototype demonstrating privacy-safe updates
- A/B testing framework allowing gradual model rollout
- Performance monitoring tracking accuracy, speed, and resource usage
- Model drift detection system operational

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on production-ready ML optimization
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S25 (Security Scoring System must be completed)
- Consider battery and memory constraints for mobile deployment
- Plan for model updates without app store releases
