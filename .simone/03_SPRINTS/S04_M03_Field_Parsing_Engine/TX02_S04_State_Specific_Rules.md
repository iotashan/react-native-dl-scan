# Task: State-Specific Parsing Rules Implementation

## Description
Implement specialized parsing rules and patterns for the top 10 US states (CA, TX, FL, NY, IL, PA, OH, GA, NC, MI) to handle license layout variations, format differences, and state-specific field patterns. This builds on the core parsing engine to provide state-aware field extraction.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a comprehensive rule system that can accurately parse license fields across different state formats with high precision and coverage.
- Implement state-specific parsing patterns for top 10 US states
- Handle license number format variations per state
- Adapt to different layout structures and field positioning
- Provide fallback rules for unknown state formats

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parsing rules implemented for CA, TX, FL, NY, IL, PA, OH, GA, NC, MI
- [ ] State-specific license number patterns correctly validated
- [ ] Layout variations handled for each target state
- [ ] Automatic state detection from license content or format
- [ ] 90%+ field extraction accuracy on well-positioned licenses from target states
- [ ] Graceful fallback to generic parsing for non-target states
- [ ] State-specific error correction for common OCR mistakes

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Core Parser Extension**: Build on T01_S04 `FieldExtractor` class
- **State Detection**: Integrate with existing address parsing in `LicenseData.address` structure
- **Pattern Storage**: Use efficient pattern matching system for state rules
- **Fallback Logic**: Integrate with generic parsing when state-specific rules fail

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Data Structure**: Extend existing `LicenseData` interface for state-specific metadata
- **Validation Logic**: Follow validation patterns from existing barcode parsing
- **Error Handling**: Use established error propagation from `LicenseParser.swift`
- **State Field Mapping**: Reference existing `issuingState` handling in barcode parser

### Implementation Notes

**State Rule Architecture:**
1. **State Detection**: Identify state from license indicators, address, or format patterns
2. **Rule Selection**: Choose appropriate parsing rules based on detected state
3. **Format-Specific Parsing**: Apply state-specific field extraction patterns
4. **Validation**: Verify extracted data against state-specific validation rules
5. **Error Correction**: Apply state-aware OCR error correction patterns

**State-Specific Patterns to Implement:**
- **CA**: License format `[A-Z]\d{7}`, Last/First/Middle name layout, specific address format
- **TX**: License format `\d{8}`, First/Middle/Last name layout, different DOB format
- **FL**: License format `[A-Z]\d{12}`, specific height/weight format patterns
- **NY**: License format `\d{9}|\d{3} \d{3} \d{3}`, specific restriction codes
- **IL**: License format `[A-Z]\d{11}`, specific endorsement patterns

**Error Correction Strategies:**
- Common OCR mistakes: 0↔O, 1↔I, 5↔S, 8↔B based on state context
- State-specific character substitutions in license numbers
- Name formatting corrections (Jr./Sr./III handling)
- Date format standardization per state conventions

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `StateRuleEngine` class with state detection from license content
- [ ] Validate regex patterns for each target state's license number format
- [ ] Test layout parsing rules with various orientations per state
- [ ] Verify name parsing variations specific to each state's format
- [ ] Test address format handlers with real state address patterns
- [ ] Validate date parsing with state-specific format variations
- [ ] Test OCR error correction patterns for each state's common mistakes

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete state-specific parsing pipeline with T01_S04 core engine
- [ ] Validate fallback to generic parsing for non-target states
- [ ] Test state detection accuracy with mixed license formats
- [ ] Verify 90% field extraction accuracy requirement with state-specific rules

### Simulator Testing with Camera Mocking
- [ ] Create mock license datasets for CA, TX, FL, NY, IL, PA, OH, GA, NC, MI
- [ ] Test state-specific parsing with simulated camera captures
- [ ] Mock varying OCR quality for each state's license format
- [ ] Test automatic state detection from mock license content

### Test Scenarios
1. **California License**: Format `[A-Z]\d{7}` with Last/First/Middle layout
2. **Texas License**: Format `\d{8}` with First/Middle/Last layout  
3. **Florida License**: Format `[A-Z]\d{12}` with height/weight patterns
4. **New York License**: Format `\d{9}|\d{3} \d{3} \d{3}` with restriction codes
5. **Illinois License**: Format `[A-Z]\d{11}` with endorsement patterns
6. **Mixed State Testing**: Random state licenses for detection accuracy
7. **Unknown State Fallback**: Non-target state licenses using generic parsing
8. **Damaged State Indicators**: Obscured state text requiring inference

### Test Fixtures and Mock Data
- [ ] Authentic license number patterns for each target state
- [ ] State-specific layout templates with field positioning data
- [ ] OCR error patterns common to each state (0↔O, 1↔I, 5↔S, 8↔B)
- [ ] Address format variations per state for validation
- [ ] Date format examples (MM/DD/YYYY vs variations) per state
- [ ] Name formatting variations (Jr./Sr./III) by state conventions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for state rule selection overhead
