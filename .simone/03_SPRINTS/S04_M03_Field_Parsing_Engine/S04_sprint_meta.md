# Sprint: Field Parsing Engine (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Implement intelligent field extraction engine with state-specific parsing rules and confidence scoring to transform raw OCR text into structured license data.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Heuristic Parsing Engine:** Core algorithm for field identification and extraction
- **State-Specific Rules:** Parsing patterns for top 10 US states (CA, TX, FL, NY, etc.)
- **Field Extraction Logic:** Name, address, license number, DOB, physical description parsing
- **Confidence Scoring System:** Reliability assessment for each extracted field
- **Error Correction:** Handle common OCR errors (0→O, 1→I, character substitutions)
- **Multi-State Support:** Handle layout variations across different license formats

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- 80%+ field extraction accuracy on well-positioned licenses
- State-specific parsing rules implemented for top 10 states
- Confidence scoring provides actionable reliability metrics
- Common OCR errors automatically corrected
- Field extraction handles multiple name/address formats
- Performance maintains <500ms processing time for parsing
- Integration ready for fallback system (S03)

## Technical Context
Builds on S01's raw text extraction capabilities:
- Processes VNRecognizedTextObservation results from S01
- Implements pattern matching and heuristic algorithms
- Leverages quality scores from S01 for parsing confidence
- Prepares structured data for S03 fallback integration

## Dependencies
- S01 (Vision Framework OCR Setup) - Raw text extraction pipeline
- State license format research and pattern analysis
- OCR error pattern analysis for correction algorithms

## Success Criteria
- Successfully extract key fields: firstName, lastName, licenseNumber, address, dateOfBirth
- Handle layout variations across multiple state formats
- Provide confidence scores that correlate with extraction accuracy
- Correct common OCR misreads automatically
- Maintain parsing performance under 500ms
- Generate structured LicenseData objects compatible with M01 barcode parsing

## Task List
1. **T01_S04_Core_Parsing_Engine** - Core heuristic algorithm for field identification and extraction
2. **T02_S04_State_Specific_Rules** - Parsing patterns for top 10 US states (CA, TX, FL, NY, IL, PA, OH, GA, NC, MI)  
3. **T03_S04_Confidence_Error_System** - Combined confidence scoring and OCR error correction system

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Start with high-confidence states (CA, TX) before expanding
- Focus on accuracy metrics and validation against known good data
- Prepare comprehensive test data set with various state licenses
- Document parsing rule logic for future state additions
