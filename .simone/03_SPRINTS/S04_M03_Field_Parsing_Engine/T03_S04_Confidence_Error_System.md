# Task: Confidence Scoring and Error Correction System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive reliability assessment system that provides confidence scores for extracted fields and automatically corrects common OCR errors. This system combines confidence scoring with error correction to ensure high-quality field extraction results.

## Goal / Objectives
Create an intelligent confidence and error correction system that provides actionable reliability metrics and improves extraction accuracy through automated error correction.
- Implement multi-factor confidence scoring for each extracted field
- Build automatic OCR error correction for common character misreads
- Provide overall reliability assessment for complete license extraction
- Enable confidence-based decision making for fallback scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Confidence scores calculated for each extracted field (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
- [ ] Overall confidence score correlates with actual extraction accuracy
- [ ] Common OCR errors automatically corrected (0→O, 1→I, 5→S, 8→B, etc.)
- [ ] Character substitution errors corrected in license numbers and names
- [ ] Confidence-based thresholds for field acceptance/rejection
- [ ] Integration with existing error handling framework
- [ ] Performance impact <50ms additional processing time

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Core Parser Integration**: Extend T01_S04 `FieldExtractor` with confidence calculation
- **State Rules Integration**: Leverage T02_S04 state-specific validation for confidence
- **Error Interface**: Integrate with existing `ScanError` handling patterns
- **Data Enhancement**: Extend `LicenseData` interface to include confidence metadata

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Error Handling**: Follow established patterns from `src/hooks/useLicenseScanner.ts:42-60`
- **Data Validation**: Reference existing validation logic in barcode parsing
- **Logging**: Use existing logger utility for confidence and error correction tracking
- **Type Safety**: Maintain optional field handling with confidence annotations

### Implementation Notes

**Confidence Scoring Algorithm:**
1. **Pattern Match Confidence**: Regex pattern match strength and coverage
2. **Validation Confidence**: Field format validation and cross-field consistency
3. **OCR Quality Confidence**: Text recognition confidence from Vision Framework
4. **State Rule Confidence**: State-specific validation and format compliance
5. **Contextual Confidence**: Field relationships and logical consistency checks

**Error Correction Strategies:**
- **Character-Level**: Common OCR misreads based on visual similarity
- **Context-Aware**: Corrections based on field type and expected format
- **State-Specific**: Corrections tailored to state license patterns
- **Cross-Field Validation**: Use other fields to validate and correct ambiguous cases
- **Pattern-Based**: License number and date format corrections

**Confidence Factors:**
- OCR recognition confidence from `VNRecognizedTextObservation.confidence`
- Regex pattern match strength and completeness
- Field format validation success rate
- Cross-field consistency validation
- State-specific rule compliance

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `ConfidenceCalculator` with varying OCR quality inputs
- [ ] Validate confidence scoring algorithm with known good/bad extractions
- [ ] Test `ErrorCorrector` with common OCR error patterns (0↔O, 1↔I, 5↔S, 8↔B)
- [ ] Verify character substitution tables accuracy for each error type
- [ ] Test context-aware error correction with field-specific patterns
- [ ] Validate cross-field validation logic for consistency checks
- [ ] Test confidence threshold behavior for field acceptance/rejection

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete confidence + error correction pipeline with T01_S04 core engine
- [ ] Validate confidence scores correlation with actual extraction accuracy
- [ ] Test error correction integration with T02_S04 state-specific rules
- [ ] Verify <50ms performance impact requirement for confidence calculation

### Simulator Testing with Camera Mocking
- [ ] Create mock OCR data with varying confidence levels (0.1-0.9)
- [ ] Test error correction with simulated OCR mistakes in controlled scenarios
- [ ] Mock VNRecognizedTextObservation confidence values for testing
- [ ] Test confidence-based fallback decisions with poor quality mock data

### Test Scenarios
1. **High-Confidence Perfect OCR**: Clear text with >0.8 Vision confidence
2. **Medium-Confidence with Errors**: Readable text with common OCR mistakes
3. **Low-Confidence Poor Quality**: Blurry/damaged text requiring heavy correction
4. **Mixed-Confidence Fields**: Some fields clear, others requiring correction
5. **Cross-Field Validation**: Consistency checks between related fields
6. **State-Specific Error Patterns**: OCR errors specific to each state's format
7. **Confidence Threshold Testing**: Border cases around acceptance thresholds
8. **Performance Stress Testing**: High-volume confidence calculations

### Test Fixtures and Mock Data
- [ ] OCR confidence level datasets (0.1-0.9) with known accuracy rates
- [ ] Character substitution error examples for each common mistake type
- [ ] Cross-field validation test cases (name consistency, date validation)
- [ ] State-specific error correction patterns for each target state
- [ ] Performance benchmarking data for <50ms requirement validation
- [ ] LicenseData samples with confidence metadata for validation
- [ ] Error correction accuracy measurements for algorithm tuning
