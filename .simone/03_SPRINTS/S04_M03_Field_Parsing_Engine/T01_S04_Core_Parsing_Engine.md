# Task: Core Parsing Engine for OCR Field Extraction

## Description
Build the foundational heuristic algorithm for intelligent field identification and extraction from OCR text results. This engine will analyze raw text observations from Vision Framework and identify key license fields using pattern matching, positioning analysis, and contextual clues.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust parsing engine that can intelligently extract license fields from unstructured OCR text with high accuracy and reliability.
- Implement core field identification algorithms
- Handle various text layouts and orientations
- Provide foundation for state-specific parsing rules
- Establish confidence scoring framework

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parser processes VNRecognizedTextObservation results from Vision Framework
- [ ] Successfully identifies and extracts core fields: firstName, lastName, licenseNumber, address, dateOfBirth
- [ ] Handles multiple text layout variations (vertical, horizontal alignment)
- [ ] Provides confidence scores for each extracted field
- [ ] Processing time <500ms for typical license OCR results
- [ ] Returns structured LicenseData compatible with existing barcode parsing format

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Input Interface**: Process `VNRecognizedTextObservation` arrays from Vision Framework
- **Output Format**: Return `LicenseData` objects matching existing interface in `src/types/license.ts`
- **Error Handling**: Follow existing `ScanError` patterns from `src/hooks/useLicenseScanner.ts`
- **Swift Integration**: Extend `LicenseParser.swift` class with OCR parsing capabilities

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Data Formatting**: Use `formatForReactNative()` pattern from `LicenseParser.swift:17`
- **Error Propagation**: Follow error handling in `LicenseParser.swift:5-15`
- **Type Safety**: Maintain optional field handling as in existing `LicenseData` interface
- **Logging**: Use existing logger utility for debugging field extraction

### Implementation Notes

**Core Algorithm Structure:**
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Normalize OCR text, handle rotations and orientations
2. **Field Detection**: Use regex patterns and positioning heuristics to identify field types
3. **Data Extraction**: Extract field values using contextual analysis and validation
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate reliability scores based on pattern matches and validation
5. **Result Assembly**: Format extracted data into standard `LicenseData` structure

**Key Components to Implement:**
- `FieldExtractor` class for core parsing logic
- `TextPreprocessor` for OCR text normalization
- `ConfidenceCalculator` for reliability assessment
- `FieldValidator` for data validation and cleanup

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use efficient string processing and regex compilation
- Implement early termination for high-confidence matches
- Cache compiled patterns for repeated use
- Optimize for iOS Neural Engine processing capabilities

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `FieldExtractor` class with various OCR text inputs
- [ ] Validate text preprocessing for different orientations and quality levels
- [ ] Test regex patterns against known field formats from all target states
- [ ] Verify positional analysis accuracy with various license layouts
- [ ] Test confidence scoring algorithm with high/medium/low quality inputs
- [ ] Validate field validation logic with edge cases and malformed data

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete parsing pipeline with real OCR data from Vision Framework
- [ ] Validate LicenseData output format consistency with existing barcode parsing
- [ ] Test error handling integration with existing ScanError patterns
- [ ] Verify performance requirements (<500ms) with realistic OCR inputs

### Simulator Testing with Camera Mocking
- [ ] Create mock OCR data representing various license quality scenarios
- [ ] Test parsing with simulated poor lighting/blur conditions
- [ ] Mock VNRecognizedTextObservation arrays with different confidence levels
- [ ] Test fallback behavior when OCR quality is insufficient

### Test Scenarios
1. **High-Quality License Parsing**: Perfect OCR with all fields clearly readable
2. **Partial OCR Results**: Missing or corrupted fields requiring inference
3. **Poor Quality/Blurry Text**: Low confidence OCR requiring error correction
4. **Rotated/Angled Licenses**: Text orientation and normalization challenges
5. **Damaged Licenses**: Torn, worn, or obscured text areas
6. **Edge Cases**: Unusual layouts, extra text, or non-standard formatting

### Test Fixtures and Mock Data
- [ ] Sample VNRecognizedTextObservation arrays for each test scenario
- [ ] Mock license images with varying quality levels for simulator testing
- [ ] Expected LicenseData output for validation against parsing results
- [ ] Performance benchmarking data for 500ms requirement validation
- [ ] OCR confidence level variations (0.1-0.9) for robustness testing

### Subtasks
- [ ] Create `FieldExtractor` Swift class with core parsing logic
- [ ] Implement text preprocessing and normalization functions
- [ ] Build regex patterns for common field identification
- [ ] Add positional analysis for layout-aware parsing
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring algorithm
- [ ] Create field validation and cleanup logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] **Create unit test suite for FieldExtractor class**
- [ ] **Build mock OCR data generator for simulator testing**
- [ ] **Implement integration tests with Vision Framework mocking**
- [ ] **Create performance benchmarking test framework**
- [ ] **Add test scenarios for edge cases and error conditions**
- [ ] Performance optimization and benchmarking
