# Sprint: Sprint 22 - Synthetic Data Processing and Model Training (S22)

## Sprint Goal
Process full IDNet synthetic dataset, train lightweight fraud detection models, and convert to Core ML format for mobile deployment.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Process all 600,000 IDNet synthetic images for training
- Implement data augmentation strategies for robustness
- Train lightweight fraud detection models optimized for mobile
- Fine-tune models for specific document types and forgery patterns
- Convert trained models to Core ML format for iOS
- Validate model performance on synthetic test set
- Optimize model size and inference speed for mobile deployment

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Full IDNet dataset processed and ready for training
- Multiple fraud detection models trained with different architectures
- Models achieving >95% accuracy on synthetic fraud detection
- Core ML conversion completed with size <50MB per model
- Inference time <200ms on target iOS devices
- Model performance benchmarks documented
- Model versioning and management system established
- Training pipeline fully automated for future iterations

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on model development and optimization
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S21 (Fraud Pattern Analysis must be completed)
- Consider memory constraints for mobile deployment
- Balance model accuracy with inference speed requirements
