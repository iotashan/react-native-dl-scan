# Sprint: Sprint 24 - Fraud Detection Engine Implementation (S24)

## Sprint Goal
Implement comprehensive fraud detection engine with document texture analysis, security feature verification, and anomaly detection capabilities.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement document texture and material analysis algorithms
- Add security feature verification (holograms, watermarks, microprint)
- Create layout anomaly detection for inconsistencies
- Build multi-factor authentication logic for documents
- Implement fraud pattern matching against known forgery types
- Create real-time fraud detection pipeline
- Develop fraud detection confidence scoring system

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Document texture analysis module fully operational
- Security feature detection achieving >95% accuracy for known features
- Layout anomaly detection identifying all major inconsistencies
- Multi-factor authentication logic implemented and tested
- Fraud pattern matching system operational with sub-second response
- Real-time pipeline processing documents in <500ms
- Confidence scoring system providing granular risk assessment
- All modules integrated into unified fraud detection engine

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint begins Phase 2 enhanced security implementation
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S23 (Cross-Dataset Framework must be completed)
- Focus on detection accuracy while maintaining performance
- Consider false positive impact on user experience
