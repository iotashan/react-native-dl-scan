# Sprint: Sprint 25 - Security Scoring and Risk Assessment System (S25)

## Sprint Goal
Build comprehensive security scoring system with adaptive thresholds, risk-based validation levels, and detailed audit logging for security events.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement composite confidence scoring algorithm
- Create risk score calculation combining multiple signals
- Build adaptive threshold system based on risk levels
- Implement context-aware validation levels
- Create detailed audit logging for security events
- Develop security metrics dashboard
- Implement alert system for high-risk detections

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Composite scoring algorithm combining OCR and fraud signals
- Risk calculation producing scores from 0-100 with clear categories
- Adaptive thresholds adjusting based on document type and context
- Validation levels (low/medium/high) implemented with clear criteria
- Audit logging capturing all security events without PII
- Security dashboard showing real-time metrics and trends
- Alert system operational for configurable risk thresholds
- False positive rate <2% on legitimate documents

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on intelligent risk assessment
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S24 (Fraud Detection Engine must be completed)
- Balance security strictness with user convenience
- Ensure audit logs comply with privacy regulations
