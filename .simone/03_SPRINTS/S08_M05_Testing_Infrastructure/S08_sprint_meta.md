# Sprint S08: Testing Infrastructure & CI/CD

## Sprint Goal
Establish comprehensive testing infrastructure, implement CI/CD pipeline, and achieve 80%+ test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E tests.

## Deliverables
1. Unit test framework for Swift and React Native code
2. Integration test suite for bridge and camera functionality
3. E2E test scenarios with device testing
4. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
5. Performance benchmarking framework

## Dependencies
- M04 completion (UI components and integration)
- Stable API from all previous modules
- Test devices/simulators availability

## Tasks
- [x] T01_S08 - Unit Test Framework Setup
- [x] T02_S08 - Integration Test Suite
- [x] T03_S08 - E2E Test Implementation
- [x] T04_S08 - CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- 60% unit test coverage achieved
- 30% integration test coverage achieved
- 10% E2E test coverage achieved
- CI/CD runs in <10 minutes
- All tests pass on iPhone 14 Pro and iPad M3

## Architecture Decisions
- TBD - Will be linked after ADR creation

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Achieving 80% coverage may be challenging
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on critical paths first, use coverage reports to guide efforts
- **Risk:** E2E tests may be flaky
  - **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic and proper test isolation

## Notes
- Use Jest for React Native tests
- XCTest for Swift unit tests
- Detox or similar for E2E testing
- Include performance regression tests
