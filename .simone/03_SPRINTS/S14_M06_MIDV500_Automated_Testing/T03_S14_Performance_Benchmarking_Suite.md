# Task: Performance Benchmarking Suite

## Description
Create comprehensive performance benchmarking suite measuring processing speed, memory usage, battery impact, and resource utilization across different device configurations and shooting conditions.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking for scanning pipeline
- Measure processing speed, memory usage, and battery impact
- Test performance across device configurations and shooting conditions
- Generate baseline performance metrics for optimization guidance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite measuring speed, memory, and battery usage
- [ ] Device-specific performance testing across different hardware configurations
- [ ] Condition-specific benchmarking for all 5 MIDV-500 shooting conditions
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established for current scanning pipeline
- [ ] Automated performance reporting with optimization recommendations

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S13 T04 performance metrics collection framework
- Integrate with S13 T06 memory and performance optimization
- Use S12 T05 shooting condition support for condition-specific testing
- Leverage S13 T07 cross-device support for hardware variation testing
