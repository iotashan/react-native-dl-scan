# Task: OCR Accuracy Validation Suite

## Description
Implement comprehensive automated OCR accuracy validation suite testing all text fields against MIDV-500 ground truth data with field-specific validation rules and accuracy thresholds.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create automated OCR validation for all MIDV-500 text fields
- Implement field-specific validation rules and accuracy thresholds
- Support multiple OCR accuracy measurement methodologies
- Generate comprehensive accuracy reports and analytics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated OCR testing for all text fields in MIDV-500 dataset
- [ ] Field-specific validation rules implemented (names, dates, addresses, numbers)
- [ ] Multiple accuracy measurement methods (exact match, fuzzy match, semantic validation)
- [ ] Comprehensive accuracy reporting with field-level and document-level metrics
- [ ] Threshold-based pass/fail validation with configurable accuracy requirements

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S12 T03 ground truth comparison logic
- Integrate with S13 T01 React Native testing framework
- Use S13 T04 performance metrics for accuracy trend analysis
- Leverage S11 T03 ground truth parser for field validation
