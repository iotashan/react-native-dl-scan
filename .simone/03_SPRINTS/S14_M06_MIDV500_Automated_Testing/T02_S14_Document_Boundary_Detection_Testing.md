# Task: Document Boundary Detection Testing

## Description
Implement automated document boundary detection validation using quadrangle coordinate comparison against MIDV-500 ground truth with accuracy metrics and edge case handling.

## Goal / Objectives
- Validate document boundary detection using quadrangle coordinate comparison
- Implement boundary accuracy metrics with tolerance thresholds
- Test edge cases including partial occlusion and clutter conditions
- Generate boundary detection performance analytics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Quadrangle coordinate comparison implemented with configurable tolerance
- [ ] Boundary accuracy metrics including overlap percentage and corner precision
- [ ] Edge case testing for partial occlusion and clutter conditions
- [ ] Performance analytics for boundary detection accuracy across conditions
- [ ] Automated reporting with visual boundary comparison validation

## Technical Guidance
- Extend S12 T03 ground truth comparison for boundary validation
- Integrate with S12 T05 shooting condition support for edge case testing
- Use S13 T04 performance metrics for boundary detection analytics
- Build on S11 T03 ground truth parser for coordinate validation
