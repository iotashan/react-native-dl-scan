# Task: Regression Testing Framework

## Description
Implement automated regression testing framework to detect performance degradation and accuracy regressions with baseline comparison, automated alerts, and historical trend analysis.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create automated regression detection for performance and accuracy metrics
- Implement baseline comparison with historical trend analysis
- Support automated alerts for significant performance degradation
- Generate regression analysis reports with actionable insights

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Regression testing framework detecting performance and accuracy degradation
- [ ] Baseline comparison with configurable regression thresholds
- [ ] Automated alerting for significant performance or accuracy regressions
- [ ] Historical trend analysis with regression pattern identification
- [ ] Comprehensive regression reports with root cause analysis guidance

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S13 T05 basic result validation and reporting
- Integrate with S13 T04 performance metrics for regression detection
- Use S12 T06 result validation for accuracy regression analysis
- Leverage S13 T03 full dataset processing for comprehensive validation
