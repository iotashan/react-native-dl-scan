# Sprint: Sprint 14 - Automated Testing Suite Implementation (S14)

## Sprint Goal
Implement comprehensive automated testing suite with OCR accuracy validation, document boundary detection testing, and performance benchmarking.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement automated OCR accuracy validation against ground truth
- Add document boundary detection testing and validation
- Create comprehensive performance benchmarking suite
- Implement regression testing capabilities
- Add test result analytics and reporting dashboard
- Create baseline performance metrics for current scanning pipeline

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Automated OCR accuracy testing working for all text fields in MIDV-500
- Document boundary detection validation implemented with quadrangle coordinate comparison
- Performance benchmarking suite measuring speed, memory usage, and battery impact
- Regression testing framework to detect performance degradation
- Test analytics dashboard showing accuracy trends and performance metrics
- Baseline performance report for current PDF417 + OCR fallback system
- Automated test suite can run unattended and generate comprehensive reports

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint establishes the automated quality assurance foundation
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S13 (Framework Integration must be completed)
- Focus on comprehensive metrics collection to inform OCR enhancement decisions
