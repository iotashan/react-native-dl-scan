# Task: Fraud Pattern Feature Extraction

## Description
Implement comprehensive feature extraction algorithms specifically designed to identify fraud patterns in synthetic identity documents. This task focuses on extracting meaningful features from IDNet images that can distinguish between legitimate and forged documents, including texture anomalies, edge inconsistencies, and color distribution patterns.

## Goal / Objectives
- Extract discriminative features from synthetic forgery images
- Identify key fraud indicators across different forgery types
- Build feature vectors optimized for fraud detection
- Ensure features are robust to image variations
- Maintain real-time extraction performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature extraction processes all 6 IDNet forgery types
- [ ] Extracted features achieve >85% discrimination rate in validation
- [ ] Feature extraction completes in <100ms per image
- [ ] Feature vectors are consistent across similar documents
- [ ] Integration with existing quality metrics system
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
- [ ] Feature importance analysis documented

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze IDNet forgery patterns and categorize by type
- [ ] Implement texture feature extraction (LBP, Gabor filters)
- [ ] Add edge detection and consistency analysis
- [ ] Create color distribution and histogram features
- [ ] Implement frequency domain analysis (FFT patterns)
- [ ] Build feature aggregation and normalization pipeline
- [ ] Integrate with QualityMetricsProcessor pattern
- [ ] Validate features against ground truth annotations

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend `frameProcessors/qualityMetrics.ts` pattern for feature extraction
- Integrate with `QualityMetricsProcessor` for standardized processing
- Use existing `ProcessingResult` type structure
- Follow frame processor patterns for image analysis

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Leverage existing patterns
import { QualityMetricsProcessor } from '@/utils/QualityMetricsProcessor';
import type { QualityMetrics } from '@/types/qualityMetrics';
import { processFrame } from '@/frameProcessors/qualityMetrics';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Quality assessment pattern from `qualityMetrics.ts`
- Metric calculation approach from existing processors
- Result aggregation similar to scan confidence scoring
- Performance tracking using established monitors

### Database Models or API Contracts
- Extend quality metrics types for fraud features:
  - `FraudFeatures`: Comprehensive feature vector
  - `TextureMetrics`: Texture-based indicators
  - `EdgeMetrics`: Edge consistency measures
  - `ColorMetrics`: Color distribution features

### Error Handling Approach
- Graceful handling of partial feature extraction
- Fallback to basic features on complex image failures
- Log feature extraction performance and failures
- Provide confidence scores for each feature type

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Study IDNet forgery types and their characteristics
2. Implement basic texture analysis (Local Binary Patterns)
3. Add edge detection using Canny/Sobel operators
4. Create color histogram and distribution features
5. Implement frequency domain analysis for periodic patterns
6. Build feature vector aggregation logic
7. Add normalization and scaling for ML compatibility
8. Integrate performance monitoring and optimization

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Modular feature extractors for extensibility
- Parallel feature extraction where possible
- Feature caching for repeated analysis
- Configurable feature selection based on use case

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual feature extractors
- Integration tests with known forgery patterns
- Performance benchmarks for extraction speed
- Feature quality validation against ground truth

### Performance Considerations
- Use native image processing where available
- Implement feature extraction in parallel
- Cache intermediate computations
- Optimize for common forgery patterns first
