# Sprint: Sprint 21 - IDNet Fraud Pattern Analysis and Feature Extraction (S21)

## Sprint Goal
Implement IDNet dataset processing pipeline, extract fraud pattern features from synthetic data, and establish baseline fraud detection capabilities.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement IDNet dataset loading and preprocessing pipeline
- Extract and categorize fraud pattern features from synthetic images
- Analyze document texture, security features, and typography patterns
- Develop feature extraction algorithms for forgery detection
- Create fraud pattern taxonomy based on IDNet variations
- Build initial fraud detection prototype for testing
- Establish performance benchmarks for fraud detection

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- IDNet dataset processing pipeline fully operational
- Feature extraction algorithms implemented and tested
- Fraud pattern taxonomy documented with examples
- Document texture analysis module completed
- Security feature detection algorithms implemented
- Typography consistency checker developed
- Initial fraud detection prototype achieving >90% accuracy on test set
- Performance benchmarks established for processing time

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on understanding and extracting fraud patterns
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S20 (IDNet Dataset Integration must be completed)
- Critical for establishing fraud detection foundation
- Balance between detection accuracy and processing speed
