# Sprint: Sprint 21 - IDNet Fraud Pattern Analysis and Feature Extraction (S21)

## Sprint Goal
Implement IDNet dataset processing pipeline, extract fraud pattern features from synthetic data, and establish baseline fraud detection capabilities.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement IDNet dataset loading and preprocessing pipeline
- Extract and categorize fraud pattern features from synthetic images
- Analyze document texture, security features, and typography patterns
- Develop feature extraction algorithms for forgery detection
- Create fraud pattern taxonomy based on IDNet variations
- Build initial fraud detection prototype for testing
- Establish performance benchmarks for fraud detection

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
