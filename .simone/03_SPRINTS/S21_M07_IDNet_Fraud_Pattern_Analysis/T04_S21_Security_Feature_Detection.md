# Task: Security Feature Detection

## Description
Develop algorithms to detect and verify security features present in identity documents, including holograms, watermarks, UV features, microprinting, and other anti-counterfeiting elements. This module will identify the presence, quality, and authenticity of these security features to detect sophisticated forgeries.

## Goal / Objectives
- Detect presence of expected security features
- Verify authenticity of holograms and reflective elements
- Identify watermarks and hidden patterns
- Analyze microprinting and fine details
- Assess security feature quality and consistency
- Flag missing or tampered security elements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detects 90% of standard security features in test set
- [ ] Processes security analysis in <200ms per document
- [ ] Identifies tampered or fake security elements
- [ ] Handles various lighting conditions for hologram detection
- [ ] Provides confidence scores for each security feature
- [ ] Integrates with overall fraud detection pipeline
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for security patterns

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research common ID security features and variations
- [ ] Implement hologram detection using reflection analysis
- [ ] Add watermark detection in different channels
- [ ] Create microprinting quality assessment
- [ ] Build guilloche pattern recognition
- [ ] Implement UV feature simulation detection
- [ ] Add security feature verification scoring
- [ ] Create security feature presence checklist

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend fraud detection feature pipeline
- Integrate with existing image processing infrastructure
- Use quality metrics patterns for scoring
- Follow established result aggregation patterns

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Leverage existing infrastructure
import { QualityMetrics } from '@/types/qualityMetrics';
import { processFrame } from '@/frameProcessors/qualityMetrics';
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Feature detection pattern from quality metrics
- Confidence scoring from existing processors
- Multi-stage analysis pipeline approach
- Result validation and aggregation

### Database Models or API Contracts
- Define security feature types:
  - `SecurityFeatures`: Comprehensive security assessment
  - `HologramMetrics`: Hologram detection results
  - `WatermarkMetrics`: Watermark analysis data
  - `MicroprintQuality`: Fine detail assessment

### Error Handling Approach
- Graceful degradation for poor lighting conditions
- Partial results when features are obscured
- Clear logging of detection failures
- Fallback to basic security checks

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Map common security features by document type
2. Implement reflection analysis for holograms
3. Add multi-channel watermark detection
4. Create edge enhancement for microprinting
5. Build pattern matching for guilloche designs
6. Implement feature presence verification
7. Create weighted scoring system
8. Add lighting condition normalization

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Multi-channel analysis for different features
- Adaptive thresholds based on document type
- Hierarchical feature detection approach
- Caching of security feature templates

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each security feature detector
- Integration tests with known security patterns
- Robustness testing under various conditions
- Validation against security feature database

### Performance Considerations
- Region-based processing for efficiency
- Template matching optimization
- Parallel processing of independent features
- Early exit on high-confidence detection
