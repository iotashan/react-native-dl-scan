# Task: IDNet Dataset Infrastructure

## Description
Set up the foundation for processing the IDNet synthetic identity document dataset. This task involves implementing the data loading pipeline, caching strategy, and preprocessing infrastructure that will support all subsequent fraud detection tasks. The infrastructure must handle 600,000+ synthetic images efficiently while maintaining performance targets.

## Goal / Objectives
- Establish robust dataset loading and management system for IDNet synthetic images
- Implement efficient caching mechanism to avoid redundant processing
- Create preprocessing pipeline for standardizing images for analysis
- Ensure compatibility with existing React Native architecture
- Support real-time processing requirements (<500ms overhead)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dataset loader successfully processes IDNet format (images + annotations)
- [ ] Caching system reduces redundant loads by >80%
- [ ] Preprocessing maintains image quality for fraud detection
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 75MB during processing
- [ ] Integration with existing PerformanceMonitor for metrics tracking
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >90% coverage
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research IDNet dataset structure and annotation format
- [ ] Design cache architecture compatible with React Native constraints
- [ ] Implement dataset loader with batch processing support
- [ ] Create image preprocessing pipeline (normalization, resizing)
- [ ] Integrate with existing PerformanceMonitor for tracking
- [ ] Add error handling for corrupted/missing data
- [ ] Implement unit tests for all components
- [ ] Create usage documentation

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend existing `utils/` pattern for dataset management
- Follow `QualityMetricsProcessor` pattern for processing pipeline
- Use `PerformanceMonitor` for tracking load times and memory usage
- Implement similar to `frameProcessors/` for batch processing

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Key imports to leverage
import { PerformanceMonitor } from '@/utils/PerformanceMonitor';
import type { ProcessingResult } from '@/types/processing';
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Error handling pattern from `utils/FallbackController.ts`
- Caching pattern similar to frame buffer management
- Async processing with timeout management like `ScanTimeoutManager`
- Type definitions following `types/license.ts` structure

### Database Models or API Contracts
- Create new types in `types/fraud.ts` for IDNet data structures:
  - `IDNetImage`: Image metadata and path
  - `IDNetAnnotation`: Ground truth fraud patterns
  - `ProcessingCache`: Cache entry structure

### Error Handling Approach
- Use existing error codes pattern with new `IDNET_` prefix
- Implement graceful degradation for missing images
- Log all errors through centralized logger
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Start with type definitions for IDNet data structures
2. Implement basic file system loader for dataset access
3. Add caching layer using React Native AsyncStorage or MMKV
4. Create preprocessing pipeline with configurable steps
5. Integrate performance monitoring at key points
6. Add comprehensive error handling
7. Write unit tests alongside implementation
8. Document public API and usage patterns

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Use lazy loading to avoid memory spikes
- Implement LRU cache for processed images
- Separate preprocessing from analysis for modularity
- Design for future extension (additional datasets)

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each module component
- Integration tests with sample IDNet subset
- Performance benchmarks for load times
- Memory usage profiling under load

### Performance Considerations
- Batch processing to reduce overhead
- Image downsampling options for initial analysis
- Parallel processing where React Native allows
- Cache warming strategies for common patterns
