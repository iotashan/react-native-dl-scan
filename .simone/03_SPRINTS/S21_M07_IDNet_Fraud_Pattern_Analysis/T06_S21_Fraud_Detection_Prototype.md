# Task: Fraud Detection Prototype

## Description
Build the initial fraud detection engine that combines all analysis modules (texture, security features, typography) into a unified detection system with confidence scoring. This prototype will serve as the foundation for the production fraud detection system, demonstrating the integration of multiple fraud indicators into actionable results.

## Goal / Objectives
- Integrate all fraud analysis modules into cohesive engine
- Implement multi-factor fraud scoring algorithm
- Create confidence-based decision system
- Achieve >90% accuracy on IDNet test set
- Maintain real-time performance requirements
- Provide detailed fraud detection explanations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prototype achieves >90% accuracy on IDNet test set
- [ ] Combined processing completes in <500ms total
- [ ] Provides detailed fraud indicators and confidence scores
- [ ] Handles all 6 IDNet forgery types effectively
- [ ] Integrates seamlessly with existing scanner pipeline
- [ ] Includes comprehensive logging and debugging
- [ ] Full test coverage for detection scenarios

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design fraud detection architecture and interfaces
- [ ] Integrate texture analysis module
- [ ] Connect security feature detection
- [ ] Add typography consistency checker
- [ ] Implement weighted scoring algorithm
- [ ] Create confidence threshold system
- [ ] Build fraud explanation generator
- [ ] Add performance optimization layer
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Extend `useLicenseScanner` hook with fraud detection
- Integrate with existing `ScanController` flow
- Use `StateTransitionManager` for detection states
- Follow existing result callback patterns

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Core integration points
import { useLicenseScanner } from '@/hooks/useLicenseScanner';
import { ScanController } from '@/utils/ScanController';
import { StateTransitionManager } from '@/utils/StateTransitionManager';
import type { LicenseData, ScanResult } from '@/types/license';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- State management from `StateTransitionManager`
- Result aggregation from scan controller
- Hook integration patterns
- Performance monitoring approach

### Database Models or API Contracts
- Extend scan result types:
  - `FraudDetectionResult`: Complete fraud assessment
  - `FraudIndicators`: Individual fraud signals
  - `ConfidenceScores`: Multi-level confidence data
  - `FraudExplanation`: Human-readable explanations

### Error Handling Approach
- Graceful degradation when modules fail
- Always provide best-effort results
- Clear error logging and reporting
- Fallback to conservative detection

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Create fraud detection manager class
2. Define module integration interfaces
3. Implement parallel module execution
4. Build weighted scoring algorithm
5. Create confidence calculation logic
6. Add decision threshold system
7. Implement explanation generator
8. Integrate with scanner pipeline
9. Add comprehensive testing

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Parallel processing where possible
- Configurable weights and thresholds
- Explainable AI approach for trust

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for scoring algorithms
- Integration tests with all modules
- End-to-end IDNet validation
- Performance benchmarking suite

### Performance Considerations
- Parallel module execution
- Early exit on high-confidence fraud
- Caching of intermediate results
- Optimized for common forgery types
