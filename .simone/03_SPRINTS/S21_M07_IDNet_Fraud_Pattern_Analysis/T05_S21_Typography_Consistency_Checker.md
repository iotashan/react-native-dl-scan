# Task: Typography Consistency Checker

## Description
Implement typography analysis algorithms to detect font inconsistencies, character spacing anomalies, and layout irregularities that indicate document forgery. This module will analyze text rendering quality, font matching, baseline alignment, and character proportions to identify typography-based fraud indicators.

## Goal / Objectives
- Detect font inconsistencies across document fields
- Analyze character spacing and kerning anomalies
- Verify text baseline alignment and consistency
- Check font weight and style variations
- Identify typography-based tampering
- Assess overall typography quality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detects 85% of typography-based forgeries in test set
- [ ] Analyzes text regions in <100ms per document
- [ ] Identifies font mismatches and substitutions
- [ ] Detects character spacing anomalies
- [ ] Provides typography quality scores
- [ ] Handles multiple languages and scripts
- [ ] Complete test coverage for common forgeries

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research common typography forgery patterns
- [ ] Implement font feature extraction
- [ ] Add character spacing analysis
- [ ] Create baseline alignment detection
- [ ] Build font consistency checker
- [ ] Implement kerning anomaly detection
- [ ] Add text rendering quality assessment
- [ ] Create typography scoring system

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Integrate with OCR text extraction results
- Use existing quality metrics infrastructure
- Follow frame processor patterns
- Leverage text analysis from OCR module

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Build on OCR and quality infrastructure
import { QualityMetrics } from '@/types/qualityMetrics';
import { processOCRFrame } from '@/frameProcessors/scanOCR';
import { logger } from '@/utils/logger';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Text extraction patterns from OCR module
- Quality scoring from metrics processor
- Feature aggregation approaches
- Performance monitoring integration

### Database Models or API Contracts
- Define typography analysis types:
  - `TypographyMetrics`: Complete typography assessment
  - `FontFeatures`: Font characteristic data
  - `SpacingMetrics`: Character spacing analysis
  - `AlignmentMetrics`: Text alignment data

### Error Handling Approach
- Handle OCR failures gracefully
- Provide partial results for readable text
- Log typography analysis issues
- Clear error reporting for debugging

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Extract text regions from OCR results
2. Implement font feature extraction
3. Add character spacing measurement
4. Create baseline detection algorithm
5. Build font consistency comparison
6. Implement kerning analysis
7. Add rendering quality metrics
8. Create weighted scoring system

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Leverage existing OCR infrastructure
- Region-based typography analysis
- Statistical approach to consistency
- Configurable tolerance thresholds

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for typography algorithms
- Integration tests with OCR pipeline
- Validation against known forgeries
- Multi-language testing coverage

### Performance Considerations
- Process only text regions
- Cache font feature templates
- Optimize comparison algorithms
- Early exit on clear mismatches
