# Task: Document Texture Analysis

## Description
Implement sophisticated texture analysis algorithms to detect document forgeries by identifying anomalies in paper texture, printing patterns, and material characteristics. This module will analyze micro-patterns that distinguish genuine documents from forgeries, focusing on texture consistency, print quality, and substrate properties.

## Goal / Objectives
- Detect texture-based fraud indicators in identity documents
- Analyze paper/substrate quality and consistency
- Identify printing anomalies and pattern irregularities
- Distinguish between genuine and synthetic textures
- Provide texture-based confidence scores

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Texture analysis detects all major forgery texture patterns
- [ ] Analysis completes within 150ms per document region
- [ ] Achieves >90% accuracy on texture-based forgeries
- [ ] Integrates seamlessly with feature extraction pipeline
- [ ] Provides detailed texture quality metrics
- [ ] Handles various document materials and printing methods
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research document texture characteristics and forgery patterns
- [ ] Implement Local Binary Pattern (LBP) analysis
- [ ] Add Gabor filter bank for multi-scale texture analysis
- [ ] Create gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features
- [ ] Implement texture uniformity and consistency checks
- [ ] Add print pattern regularity detection
- [ ] Build texture anomaly scoring system
- [ ] Optimize for mobile device performance

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- Build on `frameProcessors/` patterns for image analysis
- Integrate with fraud feature extraction pipeline
- Use existing quality assessment infrastructure
- Follow established processing result patterns

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Build on existing infrastructure
import { processFrame } from '@/frameProcessors/qualityMetrics';
import type { ProcessingResult } from '@/types/processing';
import { PerformanceMonitor } from '@/utils/PerformanceMonitor';
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Image processing pipeline from frame processors
- Quality scoring pattern from `QualityMetricsProcessor`
- Result aggregation from existing analyzers
- Performance monitoring integration

### Database Models or API Contracts
- Define texture analysis types:
  - `TextureAnalysisResult`: Complete texture assessment
  - `LBPFeatures`: Local binary pattern metrics
  - `GaborFeatures`: Multi-scale texture features
  - `TextureAnomalyScore`: Anomaly detection results

### Error Handling Approach
- Handle low-quality image regions gracefully
- Provide partial results when full analysis fails
- Log texture analysis performance metrics
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Set up texture analysis module structure
2. Implement Local Binary Pattern (LBP) extraction
3. Add Gabor filter bank (multiple orientations/scales)
4. Create GLCM-based texture features
5. Build texture uniformity detection
6. Implement print pattern analysis
7. Create anomaly detection and scoring
8. Optimize algorithms for mobile performance

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Use sliding window approach for local analysis
- Implement multi-resolution texture analysis
- Cache filter banks for performance
- Separate texture features by document region

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each texture algorithm
- Integration tests with known texture forgeries
- Performance profiling on mobile devices
- Validation against texture ground truth

### Performance Considerations
- Pre-compute Gabor filter banks
- Use native image processing where available
- Implement region-based processing
- Optimize window sizes for accuracy/speed balance
