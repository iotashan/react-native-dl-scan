# Task: Add Error Handling and Quality Checks

## Description
Implement comprehensive error handling for the camera and frame processing pipeline, including camera permission management, frame quality validation, and graceful failure handling. This task ensures a robust user experience by properly handling all failure modes and providing clear feedback.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement camera permission request and handling flow
- Add frame quality validation to prevent processing poor images
- Create error recovery mechanisms for common failures
- Ensure all errors are properly translated to user-friendly messages
- Add logging and diagnostics for debugging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Camera permissions properly requested with clear messaging
- [x] Permission denial handled gracefully with instructions
- [x] Frame quality checks prevent processing of unusable frames
- [x] All Vision Framework errors properly caught and translated
- [x] Recovery suggestions provided for common errors
- [x] Logging implemented for debugging without exposing sensitive data
- [x] Error states properly reflected in UI

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement camera permission request flow
- [x] Add permission status checking and UI feedback
- [x] Create frame quality validation (blur, brightness, contrast)
- [x] Implement Vision Framework error handling
- [x] Add timeout handling for detection attempts
- [x] Create user-friendly error messages and recovery hints
- [x] Add diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Guidance

**Key interfaces and integration points:**
- Camera permissions: `useCameraPermission()` hook from Vision Camera
- Error translation: Existing `ErrorTranslator.swift` class
- Error types: Existing `ScanError` class in `src/index.tsx`
- Logging: Native iOS `os_log` for diagnostics

**Specific imports and module references:**
- `import { useCameraPermission } from 'react-native-vision-camera'`
- Native: `import os.log` for logging
- Existing: `ErrorTranslator` and `ScanError` classes

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Error structure from `ScanError` class with code, message, userMessage
- Error translation pattern in `ErrorTranslator.swift`
- Promise resolution pattern in `DlScan.mm` for error cases
- Recoverable vs non-recoverable error distinction

**Error handling approach:**
- Permission errors: Clear instructions for Settings navigation
- Quality errors: Silent retry with next frame
- Detection timeouts: User message to reposition license
- System errors: Generic message with recovery suggestion

## Implementation Notes

**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Implement permission checking in React component
2. Create permission request UI with clear explanation
3. Add frame quality metrics calculation
4. Implement quality thresholds for processing
5. Extend ErrorTranslator for new error types
6. Add timeout mechanism for detection attempts
7. Create logging utility for diagnostics

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Don't expose technical details in user messages
- Maintain privacy by not logging barcode data
- Use existing error infrastructure
- Keep quality checks performant to not impact frame rate

**Testing approach:**
- Test permission flows (granted, denied, restricted)
- Test with poor quality frames (blur, dark, overexposed)
- Verify error messages are user-friendly
- Test recovery flows for each error type
- Verify no sensitive data in logs

**Performance considerations:**
- Quality checks should be fast (<5ms per frame)
- Don't block frame processing on quality checks
- Use sampling for expensive quality metrics
- Cache permission status to avoid repeated checks
