# Task: Automatic Fallback Logic Implementation

## Description
Implement intelligent automatic switching from PDF417 barcode scanning to OCR processing when barcode scanning fails or times out. This system provides seamless fallback capabilities with smart timeout handling and failure detection.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust fallback mechanism that automatically transitions from barcode to OCR scanning with optimal timing and user experience.
- Implement automatic detection of barcode scanning failures
- Add intelligent timeout mechanisms for barcode attempts
- Create seamless transition to OCR fallback mode
- Provide clear user feedback during mode switching

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic fallback triggers correctly when barcode scanning fails
- [ ] Configurable timeout for barcode scanning attempts (default 3-4 seconds)
- [ ] Seamless transition to OCR mode without user intervention
- [ ] User feedback indicating mode switch and progress
- [ ] Total fallback process completes in <4 seconds (barcode + OCR)
- [ ] Manual mode override capabilities for testing
- [ ] Integration with existing error handling framework

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Existing Barcode Logic**: Extend current PDF417 scanning from M01 completion
- **OCR Integration**: Interface with S04 field parsing engine results
- **React Hook Enhancement**: Extend `useLicenseScanner` with fallback support
- **Error Handling**: Integrate with existing `ScanError` patterns and recovery logic

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Hook Structure**: Follow existing `useLicenseScanner` state management patterns
- **Error Handling**: Use established error propagation from `LicenseParser.swift`
- **Async Operations**: Follow existing promise-based scanning architecture
- **Logging**: Use existing logger utility for fallback transition tracking

### Implementation Notes

**Fallback Decision Logic:**
1. **Timeout Detection**: Monitor barcode scanning duration and trigger fallback
2. **Failure Detection**: Detect barcode decoding failures and error conditions
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate frame quality for barcode vs OCR suitability
4. **User Guidance**: Provide clear feedback about scanning mode and progress
5. **Mode Coordination**: Ensure clean transition between scanning methods

**Integration Architecture:**
- **Frame Processing**: Coordinate between PDF417 and OCR frame processors
- **State Management**: Extend existing React state to track scanning mode
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures in both barcode and OCR modes gracefully
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track timing metrics for both scanning methods

**Fallback Triggers:**
- Barcode scanning timeout (configurable, default 3-4 seconds)
- PDF417 decoding failures after sufficient attempts
- Frame quality insufficient for barcode scanning
- Manual user override for testing/accessibility

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `FallbackController` mode management with various timeout scenarios
- [ ] Validate timeout configuration and monitoring accuracy
- [ ] Test failure detection logic with simulated PDF417 decoding failures
- [ ] Verify seamless transition mechanism timing and state management
- [ ] Test user feedback mechanisms for different fallback scenarios
- [ ] Validate manual mode override functionality and state consistency

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete fallback pipeline from PDF417 timeout to OCR completion
- [ ] Validate integration with existing `useLicenseScanner` hook patterns
- [ ] Test error handling integration across both scanning modes
- [ ] Verify <4 second total processing requirement under various conditions

### Simulator Testing with Camera Mocking
- [ ] Mock PDF417 scanning failures to trigger automatic fallback
- [ ] Test timeout behavior with controlled delays in barcode processing
- [ ] Mock poor quality frames that favor OCR over barcode scanning
- [ ] Test manual fallback triggers in simulator environment

### Test Scenarios
1. **Timeout-Based Fallback**: Barcode scanning exceeds 3-4 second threshold
2. **Failure-Based Fallback**: PDF417 decoding consistently fails
3. **Quality-Based Fallback**: Frame quality insufficient for barcode scanning
4. **Manual Override Fallback**: User-initiated switch to OCR mode
5. **Rapid Success Scenarios**: Quick barcode detection preventing unnecessary fallback
6. **Mixed Quality Sessions**: Multiple licenses with varying scanning requirements
7. **Performance Edge Cases**: System under load affecting timing thresholds
8. **Error Recovery Testing**: Fallback failures requiring additional error handling

### Test Fixtures and Mock Data
- [ ] Mock frame processors with configurable delay and failure rates
- [ ] Timeout configuration test scenarios (1s, 3s, 5s, 10s)
- [ ] PDF417 scanning failure simulation patterns
- [ ] Frame quality assessment mock data for decision making
- [ ] Performance timing benchmarks for <4 second requirement validation
- [ ] User feedback state transitions for UI testing
- [ ] Manual override test cases for accessibility and debugging

### Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `FallbackController` class for mode management
- [ ] Add timeout configuration and monitoring for barcode scanning
- [ ] Create failure detection logic for PDF417 decoding
- [ ] Implement seamless transition mechanism between modes
- [ ] Extend `useLicenseScanner` hook with fallback state management
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanisms for mode switching

- [ ] **Implement integration tests for complete fallback pipeline**
- [ ] **Create performance benchmarks for <4 second requirement**
- [ ] **Add simulator testing with mock camera frame scenarios**
