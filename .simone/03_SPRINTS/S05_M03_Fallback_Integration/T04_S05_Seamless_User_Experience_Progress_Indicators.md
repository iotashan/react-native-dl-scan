# Task: Seamless User Experience with Progress Indicators

## Description
Implement comprehensive UI/UX enhancements to provide transparent mode switching with real-time progress indicators during the scanning process. This task focuses on creating a seamless user experience that clearly communicates the scanning state, mode transitions, and progress to users, ensuring they understand what's happening during automatic fallback from barcode to OCR scanning.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a transparent and informative scanning experience that:
- Provides clear visual feedback during mode transitions
- Shows real-time progress indicators for both barcode and OCR scanning
- Communicates scanning states effectively to reduce user confusion
- Maintains smooth transitions without jarring UI changes
- Ensures accessibility compliance with progress announcements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress indicators accurately reflect current scanning state (idle, barcode, ocr, fallback_transition)
- [ ] Mode switching animations complete smoothly within 300ms
- [ ] User receives clear feedback when barcode scanning times out and OCR begins
- [ ] Progress messages are contextual and helpful (e.g., "Looking for barcode...", "Switching to text recognition...")
- [ ] Accessibility announcements work correctly for state changes
- [ ] No UI flicker or jarring transitions during mode switches
- [ ] Progress indicators are cancelable with clear affordances
- [ ] Performance impact of UI updates is <5% on scanning speed

## Subtasks
- [ ] Enhance ScanProgress interface with detailed UI state information
- [ ] Implement progress state machine in useLicenseScanner hook
- [ ] Create progress message generation logic based on scanning state
- [ ] Add transition animations for mode switching
- [ ] Implement accessibility announcements for state changes
- [ ] Create cancelation UI flow with proper cleanup
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for UI update impact
- [ ] Update CameraScanner component to display progress indicators
- [ ] Write unit tests for progress state transitions
- [ ] Test accessibility features with VoiceOver
- [ ] Document progress indicator states and messages

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- `src/types/license.ts` - ScanProgress interface for progress state
- `src/hooks/useLicenseScanner.ts` - Main hook managing scanning state
- `src/utils/FallbackController.ts` - Controller emitting progress events
- `src/components/CameraScanner.tsx` - UI component for display
- `FallbackControllerEvents.onProgressUpdate` - Progress event handler

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
import type { ScanProgress, ScanningState } from '../types/license';
import { FallbackController, FallbackControllerEvents } from '../utils/FallbackController';
import { useLicenseScanner, LicenseScannerState } from '../hooks/useLicenseScanner';
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Event-driven progress updates via FallbackController
- React hooks for state management (useState, useCallback, useRef)
- Logger utility for performance tracking
- Error boundary pattern for UI error handling

### Database models or API contracts to work with
- ScanProgress interface needs enhancement for UI state
- FallbackControllerEvents for progress event propagation
- ScanningState enum for state machine implementation

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Graceful fallback with user-friendly messages
- Recovery suggestions in error states
- Clear error boundaries to prevent UI crashes

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. Extend ScanProgress interface with UI-specific fields (animation state, progress percentage, detailed messages)
2. Implement progress state machine in useLicenseScanner to track transitions
3. Create message generator utility that maps states to user-friendly messages
4. Add React state for UI animations and transitions
5. Implement accessibility hooks for announcements
6. Integrate with existing FallbackController progress events
7. Update CameraScanner to render progress UI components
8. Add performance tracking to measure UI impact

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- Maintain separation between business logic (FallbackController) and UI (hooks/components)
- Keep progress updates lightweight to avoid performance impact
- Use React's concurrent features for smooth animations
- Ensure all UI updates are cancelable and cleanable

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Unit tests for state machine transitions
- Integration tests for progress event flow
- UI tests for animation timing and smoothness
- Accessibility tests with screen reader simulation
- Performance tests to validate <5% impact threshold

### Performance considerations if relevant
- Throttle progress updates to 60fps maximum
- Use React.memo for progress UI components
- Batch state updates to minimize re-renders
- Profile with React DevTools to identify bottlenecks
- Consider using CSS transitions over JS animations
