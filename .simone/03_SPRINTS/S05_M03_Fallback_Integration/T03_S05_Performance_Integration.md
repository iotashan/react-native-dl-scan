# Task: Performance Integration and Timeout Management

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance integration with timeout handling, retry mechanisms, and validation to ensure the combined barcode + OCR fallback process meets the <4 second total processing requirement. This includes smart retry logic and performance monitoring.

## Goal / Objectives
Ensure optimal performance across both scanning modes with intelligent timeout management and comprehensive performance validation.
- Implement smart timeout and retry mechanisms for both scanning modes
- Validate combined processing time meets <4 second requirement
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Create user guidance for optimal scanning conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Total fallback process (barcode attempt + OCR) completes in <4 seconds
- [ ] Configurable timeouts for barcode scanning (default 3 seconds)
- [ ] OCR processing completes in <2 seconds including field parsing
- [ ] Smart retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] Real-time performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] User guidance for poor performance scenarios

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Performance Baseline**: Build on existing M01 barcode performance requirements
- **OCR Integration**: Optimize S04 field parsing for speed requirements
- **Fallback Timing**: Coordinate with T01_S05 automatic fallback logic
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Integrate with existing logging and error tracking

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Performance Logging**: Use existing logger utility for timing and metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Follow established retry patterns from existing codebase
- **Timeout Handling**: Build on existing async operation timeout patterns
- **Metrics Collection**: Align with existing performance monitoring approaches

### Implementation Notes

**Performance Architecture:**
1. **Timing Coordination**: Orchestrate barcode and OCR timing for optimal fallback
2. **Resource Management**: Optimize memory and CPU usage during scanning
3. **Timeout Strategy**: Implement intelligent timeout management
4. **Retry Logic**: Smart retry with backoff for recoverable failures
5. **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive performance data collection

**Performance Targets:**
- **Barcode Scanning**: <3 seconds before fallback trigger
- **OCR Processing**: <2 seconds including field parsing and error correction
- **Mode Switching**: <200ms transition between barcode and OCR
- **Total Fallback**: <4 seconds from start to completion
- **Memory Usage**: <200MB active during processing

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent barcode and OCR preparation when possible
- **Early Termination**: Stop processing on high-confidence early results
- **Resource Pooling**: Reuse processing resources across scanning attempts
- **Frame Quality**: Skip poor quality frames to reduce processing overhead
- **Neural Engine**: Optimize for M3 iPad Neural Engine capabilities

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `PerformanceManager` timing coordination with various scenarios
- [ ] Validate configurable timeout management system accuracy

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test complete performance pipeline integration across all S04 and S05 components
- [ ] Validate <4 second total processing requirement with realistic workloads
- [ ] Test performance validation framework with end-to-end scanning scenarios
- [ ] Verify timeout coordination between barcode scanning and OCR processing

### Simulator Testing with Camera Mocking
- [ ] Mock varying processing loads to test timeout management
- [ ] Test performance monitoring with simulated resource constraints
- [ ] Mock frame quality variations affecting processing speed
- [ ] Test retry logic with simulated transient failures and recovery

### Test Scenarios
1. **Optimal Performance**: Fast hardware, good lighting, clear license
2. **Timeout Edge Cases**: Processing exactly at 3s/4s thresholds
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited memory/CPU affecting performance
4. **Retry Scenarios**: Transient failures requiring exponential backoff
5. **Mixed Quality Workloads**: Alternating easy/difficult license processing
6. **Stress Testing**: Continuous scanning sessions testing memory stability
7. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Performance alerts during degraded conditions
8. **Hardware Variation**: Testing across different iOS device capabilities
