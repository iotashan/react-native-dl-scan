# Sprint: Fallback Integration (S05)

## Sprint Goal
Integrate OCR scanning as seamless fallback when PDF417 barcode scanning fails, providing unified user experience with automatic mode switching and timeout handling.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **Automatic Fallback Logic:** Intelligent switching from barcode to OCR on failure/timeout
- **Unified Scanning Hook:** Enhanced useLicenseScanner with dual-mode support
- **Timeout & Retry Mechanisms:** Smart retry logic and user guidance
- **Seamless User Experience:** Transparent mode switching with progress indicators
- **Performance Integration:** Combined <2 second processing time for fallback
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of both barcode and OCR failures
- **Mode Selection:** Manual mode override capabilities (auto/barcode/ocr)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Automatic fallback triggers correctly when barcode scanning fails
- Total fallback process (barcode attempt + OCR) completes in <4 seconds
- User experience remains smooth and informative during mode switching
- Both barcode and OCR data returned in consistent LicenseData format
- Error handling covers all failure scenarios gracefully
- Performance metrics meet targets across fallback scenarios
- Manual mode selection works for testing and user preference

## Technical Context
Completes M02 by integrating S01 (OCR) + S02 (Parsing) with M01 (Barcode):
- Extends existing React Native scanning hooks
- Leverages M01's error handling patterns
- Unifies data structures from both scanning methods
- Maintains performance requirements across both modes

## Dependencies
- S01 (Vision Framework OCR Setup) - Text extraction pipeline
- S02 (Field Parsing Engine) - Structured data extraction
- M01 barcode scanning infrastructure (✅ completed)
- React Native bridge and error handling from M01

## Success Criteria
- Seamless barcode→OCR fallback with clear user feedback
- Combined processing time <4 seconds for worst-case fallback
- Consistent LicenseData format regardless of scanning method
- Error handling provides actionable guidance to users
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Manual mode override for testing and accessibility

## Task List
1. **T01_S05_Automatic_Fallback_Logic** - Intelligent switching from barcode to OCR on failure/timeout
2. **T02_S05_Unified_Scanning_Hook** - Enhanced useLicenseScanner with dual-mode support
3. **T03_S05_Performance_Integration** - Combined timeout handling and <2s processing validation
4. **T04_S05_Seamless_User_Experience_Progress_Indicators** - Transparent mode switching with progress indicators
5. **T05_S05_Performance_Validation** - Comprehensive performance validation and optimization

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Focus on user experience and performance optimization
- Ensure error messages are helpful and actionable
- Validate fallback logic with comprehensive test scenarios
- Document performance characteristics for both scanning modes
- Prepare for M03 UI integration requirements
