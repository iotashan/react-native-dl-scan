# Task: Performance Validation

## Description
Implement comprehensive performance validation and optimization to ensure the combined barcode-to-OCR fallback process meets the <2 second processing target for OCR and <4 second total fallback time. This task focuses on measuring, monitoring, and optimizing performance across both scanning modes, including transition overhead and resource utilization.

## Goal / Objectives
Validate and optimize performance to ensure:
- OCR processing completes in <2 seconds on iPad M3
- Total fallback process (barcode attempt + transition + OCR) completes in <4 seconds
- Memory usage remains stable during mode transitions
- CPU/GPU utilization is optimized for M3 Neural Engine
- Performance metrics are accurately collected and reported
- Bottlenecks are identified and addressed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] OCR processing time consistently <2 seconds (95th percentile)
- [x] Total fallback time consistently <4 seconds (95th percentile)
- [x] Memory usage increases <50MB during fallback transition
- [x] CPU usage remains <60% during peak processing
- [x] Performance metrics dashboard accurately tracks all key metrics
- [x] Automated performance regression tests pass
- [x] Performance profile shows optimal Neural Engine utilization
- [x] No memory leaks detected during extended scanning sessions

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement comprehensive performance metrics collection
- [x] Create performance benchmarking test suite
- [x] Add memory profiling for mode transitions
- [x] Implement CPU/GPU utilization monitoring
- [x] Create performance dashboard/reporting
- [x] Optimize FallbackController for minimal overhead
- [x] Profile and optimize OCR processing pipeline

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points in the codebase
- `src/types/license.ts` - ScanMetrics interface for performance data
- `src/utils/FallbackController.ts` - Main controller with timing logic
- `src/utils/logger.ts` - Performance logging infrastructure
- `src/frameProcessors/scanLicense.ts` - Native frame processor
- `FallbackControllerEvents.onMetricsUpdate` - Metrics event handler

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
import type { ScanMetrics, PerformanceMetrics } from '../types/license';
import { FallbackController, PerformanceAlert } from '../utils/FallbackController';
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Logger-based timing with start/end markers
- Event-driven metrics collection via FallbackController
- Native performance monitoring in frame processors
- Structured metrics reporting in ScanMetrics

### Database models or API contracts to work with
- ScanMetrics interface for performance data structure
- PerformanceAlert interface for threshold violations
- Logger timing API for measurement
- Native bridge performance APIs

### Error handling approach used in similar code
- Performance degradation triggers alerts, not errors
- Graceful fallback when performance thresholds exceeded
- Detailed logging of performance anomalies

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-step implementation approach
1. Extend ScanMetrics with detailed performance breakdowns
2. Implement performance collectors at key points (barcode start, OCR start, transitions)
3. Add memory profiling hooks to track allocation
4. Create performance aggregation logic for percentile calculations
5. Build automated benchmark suite with realistic test cases
6. Implement performance regression detection
7. Optimize identified bottlenecks (especially transition overhead)
8. Validate on real hardware with production-like data

### Key architectural decisions to respect
- Performance monitoring must have minimal overhead (<1%)
- Metrics collection should be non-blocking
- Use native performance APIs where available
- Maintain separation between metrics collection and business logic

### Testing approach based on existing test patterns
- Unit tests for metrics calculation logic
- Integration tests for end-to-end timing
- Performance benchmark suite with baseline comparisons
- Memory leak detection tests
- Load tests with extended scanning sessions
- Hardware-specific validation on iPad M3

### Performance considerations if relevant
- Use high-resolution timers (performance.now())
- Batch metrics updates to reduce overhead
- Profile native code with Instruments
- Optimize memory allocations in hot paths
- Leverage M3 Neural Engine for OCR processing
- Consider frame dropping strategies if needed
- Monitor thermal throttling on extended use
