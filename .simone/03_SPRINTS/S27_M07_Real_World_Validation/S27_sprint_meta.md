# Sprint: Sprint 27 - Real-World Validation and Security Testing (S27)

## Sprint Goal
Conduct comprehensive real-world validation, security audit, penetration testing, and false positive/negative rate optimization.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Test fraud detection on real-world document samples
- Conduct security audit of entire fraud detection system
- Perform penetration testing on model and infrastructure
- Optimize false positive/negative rates based on real data
- Validate performance on diverse document types
- Test edge cases and adversarial examples
- Create security hardening recommendations

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Real-world testing completed on 1000+ document samples
- Security audit report with all critical issues addressed
- Penetration testing completed with vulnerabilities patched
- False positive rate <1.5% on legitimate documents
- False negative rate <5% on known fraud patterns
- Performance validated across all supported document types
- Edge case handling improved based on testing results
- Security hardening measures implemented and verified

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint completes Phase 2 security engine work
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S26 (ML Model Training must be completed)
- Critical for production readiness validation
- Involve security experts for comprehensive audit
