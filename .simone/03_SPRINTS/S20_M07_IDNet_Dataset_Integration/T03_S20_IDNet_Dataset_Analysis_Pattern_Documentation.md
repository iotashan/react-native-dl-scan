# Task: IDNet Dataset Analysis Pattern Documentation

## Description
This task focuses on comprehensive analysis of the IDNet dataset structure, document types, forgery patterns, and ground truth data. The analysis will provide critical insights for training fraud detection models and improving the document verification capabilities of the React Native DL Scan library.

The IDNet dataset is a specialized collection containing authentic and forged identity documents, including driver's licenses, passports, and other government-issued IDs. Understanding the dataset's structure, annotation methods, and pattern distributions is essential for developing robust fraud detection algorithms that can be integrated into the existing scanning framework.

This analysis will establish the foundation for data preprocessing pipelines, statistical validation methods, and integration patterns with the current logging and performance monitoring systems.

## Goal / Objectives
Clearly define the IDNet dataset characteristics and establish comprehensive documentation for fraud detection model development:

- Objective 1: Document complete dataset structure including file organization, annotation schemas, and metadata formats
- Objective 2: Catalog document types, forgery patterns, and statistical distributions across authentic vs. forged samples
- Objective 3: Define integration patterns with existing React Native DL Scan logging, performance monitoring, and error handling systems
- Objective 4: Establish data analysis tools and visualization requirements for ongoing dataset validation and model training support
