## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Storage adapter compatibility with existing `StorageAdapter` interface in `src/utils/storage.ts`
- Performance monitoring integration using `PerformanceMonitor` class patterns
- Memory management following React Native optimization patterns
- Data validation extending existing test fixture validation approaches
- Security framework compatible with existing sensitive data handling

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Storage abstraction patterns from `src/utils/storage.ts` StorageAdapter interface
- Performance tracking patterns from `src/utils/PerformanceMonitor.ts` session management
- Memory optimization from existing frame processing in `src/frameProcessors/`
- Data validation approaches from `src/test-utils/mockOCRData.ts` fixture patterns
- Error handling patterns from `src/hooks/useErrorHandler.ts`

**Implementation Architecture:**
```typescript
// Storage Organization Structure
IDNet_Dataset/
├── metadata/              # Dataset index and validation data
│   ├── acquisition.json   # Download tracking and verification
│   ├── index.json        # Image catalog with fraud patterns
│   └── validation.json   # Integrity checks and statistics
├── images/               # Organized synthetic identity documents
│   ├── authentic/        # Non-tampered synthetic documents
│   ├── forged/          # Fraud pattern synthetic documents
│   └── compressed/      # Optimized versions for mobile access
├── cache/               # Temporary processing and access cache
└── security/            # Access logs and security metadata

// Integration Interfaces
interface IDNetDatasetAdapter extends StorageAdapter {
  acquireDataset(): Promise<DatasetAcquisitionResult>;
  validateDataset(): Promise<DatasetValidationResult>;
  getImageBatch(criteria: FraudPatternCriteria): Promise<SyntheticImage[]>;
}

interface DatasetPerformanceTracker {
  trackAcquisition(progress: AcquisitionProgress): void;
  trackAccess(operation: DatasetOperation): void;
  trackMemoryUsage(imageCount: number): void;
}
```

**Memory Management Strategy:**
```typescript
// Streaming acquisition with memory optimization
class IDNetAcquisitionManager {
  private readonly BATCH_SIZE = 1000; // Process 1000 images per batch
  private readonly MEMORY_THRESHOLD = 150; // MB limit for mobile
  private readonly compressionEnabled = true;
  
  async acquireInBatches(): Promise<void> {
    // Stream download with automatic memory management
    // Compress images on-the-fly during acquisition
    // Monitor memory usage with performance tracker
  }
}

// Mobile-optimized access patterns
class IDNetAccessManager {
  async getImagesByCriteria(
    criteria: FraudPatternCriteria,
    limit: number = 50
  ): Promise<SyntheticImage[]> {
    // Lazy loading with LRU cache
    // Automatic decompression on access
    // Memory-conscious batch processing
  }
}
```

**Security Infrastructure:**
```typescript
// Security framework for synthetic fraud data
interface SyntheticDataSecurityManager {
  validateDatasetAccess(context: AccessContext): Promise<boolean>;
  logDatasetOperation(operation: DatasetOperation): void;
  encryptSensitiveMetadata(metadata: DatasetMetadata): EncryptedMetadata;
  auditDatasetUsage(): Promise<SecurityAuditReport>;
}

// Access control for synthetic identity documents
class IDNetSecurityAdapter {
  private readonly ACCESS_PATTERNS = {
    RESEARCH: ['read', 'validate'],
    DEVELOPMENT: ['read', 'validate', 'cache'],
    TESTING: ['read', 'validate', 'batch_access']
  };
}
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Acquisition Speed**: Complete 600,000 image download within 2 hours on broadband
- **Storage Efficiency**: Achieve 30%+ compression while maintaining analysis quality
- **Access Performance**: Sub-100ms access time for individual images
- **Memory Usage**: Stay within 150MB peak memory during batch operations
- **Cache Performance**: 90%+ cache hit rate for frequently accessed fraud patterns

**Data Validation Framework:**
```typescript
interface DatasetValidation {
  verifyImageCount(): Promise<{ expected: number; actual: number; valid: boolean }>;
  validateFraudPatterns(): Promise<FraudPatternValidation>;
  checkImageIntegrity(): Promise<IntegrityReport>;
  verifyMetadata(): Promise<MetadataValidation>;
}

interface FraudPatternValidation {
  authenticDocuments: number;
  forgedDocuments: number;
  fraudTypes: string[];
  qualityMetrics: QualityAssessment;
}
```

**Integration with Existing Systems:**
- Extend `StorageAdapter` interface for dataset-specific operations
- Integrate with `PerformanceMonitor` for acquisition and access tracking
- Use existing error handling patterns from `useErrorHandler` hook
- Follow logging patterns from `src/utils/logger.ts`
- Maintain compatibility with React Native memory constraints

**Security Considerations:**
- **Access Control**: Role-based access for synthetic document data
- **Data Protection**: Encryption for sensitive metadata and fraud patterns
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of dataset access and operations
- **Compliance**: Privacy-preserving handling of synthetic identity documents
- **Secure Storage**: Protected directories with limited file system access

**Mobile Optimization:**
- **Streaming Downloads**: Progressive acquisition with pause/resume capability
- **Compression Pipeline**: Real-time image compression during acquisition
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent LRU cache with memory pressure handling
- **Background Processing**: Acquisition and validation in background threads
- **Network Resilience**: Retry logic and network failure recovery

**Testing & Validation:**
- **Unit Tests**: Acquisition pipeline components and validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: Full dataset download and organization workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage and access time benchmarks
- **Security Tests**: Access control and audit logging verification
- **Mobile Tests**: React Native memory constraints and performance validation
