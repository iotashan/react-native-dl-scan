# Sprint: Sprint 20 - IDNet Dataset Integration Foundation (S20)

## Sprint Goal
Complete M06 integration, acquire and analyze IDNet dataset structure, establish fraud detection research foundation, and design dual-validation architecture.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Complete integration and validation of M06 OCR enhancement work
- Download and set up IDNet dataset (600,000 synthetic images)
- Analyze IDNet dataset structure, document types, and forgery patterns
- Research state-of-the-art fraud detection techniques for identity documents
- Evaluate existing pre-trained models compatible with IDNet
- Design dual-validation architecture combining MIDV-500 and IDNet
- Create technical specifications for fraud detection integration

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- M06 OCR enhancements fully integrated and tested
- IDNet dataset downloaded and accessible for processing
- Dataset analysis report completed with key insights on forgery patterns
- Research summary on fraud detection techniques documented
- Pre-trained model evaluation results documented
- Dual-validation architecture design approved and documented
- Technical roadmap for next sprints finalized
- Development environment configured for fraud detection work

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint initiates the M07 milestone building on M06 achievements
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: M06 completion required
- Focus on thorough dataset understanding to guide model development
- Consider privacy implications when handling synthetic fraud data
