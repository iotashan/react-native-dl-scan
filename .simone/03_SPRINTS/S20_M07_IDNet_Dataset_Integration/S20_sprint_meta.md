# Sprint: Sprint 20 - IDNet Dataset Integration Foundation (S20)

## Sprint Goal
Complete M06 integration, acquire and analyze IDNet dataset structure, establish fraud detection research foundation, and design dual-validation architecture.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Complete integration and validation of M06 OCR enhancement work
- Download and set up IDNet dataset (600,000 synthetic images)
- Analyze IDNet dataset structure, document types, and forgery patterns
- Research state-of-the-art fraud detection techniques for identity documents
- Evaluate existing pre-trained models compatible with IDNet
- Design dual-validation architecture combining MIDV-500 and IDNet
- Create technical specifications for fraud detection integration

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- M06 OCR enhancements fully integrated and tested
- IDNet dataset downloaded and accessible for processing
- Dataset analysis report completed with key insights on forgery patterns
- Research summary on fraud detection techniques documented
- Pre-trained model evaluation results documented
- Dual-validation architecture design approved and documented
- Technical roadmap for next sprints finalized
- Development environment configured for fraud detection work

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint initiates the M07 milestone building on M06 achievements
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: M06 completion required
- Focus on thorough dataset understanding to guide model development
- Consider privacy implications when handling synthetic fraud data

## Technical Decision References

### Existing Architectural Decisions
- **Vision Framework over Open Source OCR**: Maintains 95-98% vs 80-85% accuracy
- **React Native Vision Camera with JSI**: Real-time processing with native performance
- **Offline-first processing**: All validation happens on-device for privacy
- **YUV Pixel Format**: 50% memory reduction for mobile optimization

### S20-Specific Architectural Decisions Required
- **ADR-004**: IDNet Dataset Integration Strategy
- **ADR-005**: Dual-Validation Architecture (MIDV-500 + IDNet)
- **ADR-006**: Fraud Detection Processing Pipeline
- **ADR-007**: Synthetic Data Handling and Privacy Controls

### Implementation Constraints
- Maintain iOS 15.0+ compatibility requirements
- Preserve <200MB memory usage, 10 FPS minimum performance
- Follow established Swift module structure (`ios/LicenseScanner/Core/`)
- Use JSI-based communication patterns for ML integration

## Sprint Tasks

### Task Overview
This sprint includes 5 core tasks that establish the IDNet dataset integration foundation:

1. **T01_S20_M06_Integration_Validation_Completion** (Medium Complexity)

   - Prerequisites validation before IDNet work begins

2. **T02_S20_IDNet_Dataset_Acquisition_Infrastructure** (High Complexity)
   - Download and set up IDNet dataset (600,000 synthetic images, ~5GB)
   - Storage optimization, memory management, and mobile infrastructure
   - Security framework for synthetic fraud data handling

3. **T03_S20_IDNet_Dataset_Analysis_Pattern_Documentation** (High Complexity)
   - Comprehensive analysis of IDNet structure, document types, and forgery patterns
   - Statistical analysis, pattern categorization, and ground truth documentation
   - Foundation for fraud detection model training

4. **T04_S20_Fraud_Detection_Research_Model_Evaluation** (Medium Complexity)
   - Research state-of-the-art fraud detection techniques for identity documents
