# Task: T05_S20_Dual_Validation_Architecture_Design_Specification

## Description
Design a comprehensive dual-validation architecture that combines MIDV-500 OCR accuracy capabilities with IDNet fraud detection to create a robust identity document verification system. This task involves creating technical specifications for integrating both datasets, designing system architecture, defining API interfaces, and establishing performance requirements that maintain the current React Native integration while adding advanced fraud detection capabilities.

## Technical Guidance

### Existing React Native Integration Patterns
Based on the current codebase analysis, the dual-validation architecture should leverage:

1. **JSI Frame Processor Architecture** (src/frameProcessors/scanLicense.ts):
   - Current: `scanLicense(frame: Frame): ScanLicenseResult | null`
   - Extension needed: Multi-stage processing with OCR + fraud detection
   - VisionCameraProxy plugin system for native module integration

2. **Type System Integration** (src/types/license.ts):
   - Extend `LicenseResult` interface for fraud detection metadata
   - Add fraud confidence scoring to existing confidence metrics
   - Integrate with current `PerformanceMetrics` system

3. **Performance Monitoring Integration** (src/utils/PerformanceMonitor.ts):
   - Current targets: <2s OCR, <4s fallback, <50MB memory, <60% CPU
   - Extension: Add fraud detection timing and ML model performance metrics
   - Integrate with existing checkpoint and validation system

### Architecture Requirements

#### Core Components
1. **Dual-Validation Engine**
   - OCR Accuracy Engine (MIDV-500 based)
   - Fraud Detection Engine (IDNet based)
   - Result Correlation and Scoring System
   - Confidence Aggregation Framework

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Frame preprocessing for both OCR and fraud detection
   - Parallel processing architecture for performance optimization
   - Result synchronization and correlation mechanisms
   - Quality assessment integration

3. **ML Model Integration Framework**
   - On-device model deployment for fraud detection
   - Model versioning and update mechanisms
   - A/B testing framework for model performance comparison
   - Resource optimization for mobile deployment

#### API Design Specifications

##### Enhanced Frame Processor Interface
```typescript
export interface DualValidationResult {
  ocr: {
    success: boolean;
    data?: LicenseData;
    confidence: number;
    midvScore?: number; // MIDV-500 accuracy score
  };
  fraudDetection: {
    success: boolean;
    isFraudulent: boolean;
    confidence: number;
    idnetScore?: number; // IDNet fraud detection score
    patterns?: FraudPattern[];
  };
  overall: {
    isValid: boolean;
    combinedConfidence: number;
    recommendation: 'accept' | 'reject' | 'manual_review';
  };
  performance: PerformanceMetrics;
}

export interface FraudPattern {
  type: string;
  confidence: number;
  description: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
}
```

##### Performance Extensions
```typescript
export interface FraudDetectionMetrics {
  // ML model performance
  modelInferenceTime?: number;
  modelMemoryUsage?: number;
  featureExtractionTime?: number;
  
  // IDNet specific metrics
  idnetDatasetScore?: number;
  syntheticDataConfidence?: number;
  fraudPatternMatches?: number;
  
  // Combined validation metrics
  ocrFraudCorrelation?: number;
  crossValidationScore?: number;
  finalRecommendationTime?: number;
}
```

#### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Input Processing**
   ```
   Camera Frame → Preprocessing → Parallel Processing
                                      ↓
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                    ↓                                 ↓

                    ↓                                 ↓

                    ↓                                 ↓
                    └─────────────────────────────────┘
                                      ↓
                        Result Correlation & Validation
                                      ↓
                            Final Recommendation
   ```
