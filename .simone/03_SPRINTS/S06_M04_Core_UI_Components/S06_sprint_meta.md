# Sprint S06: Core UI Components & Camera Integration

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational UI components for the dual-mode scanning interface, including camera integration, basic mode selection, and result display infrastructure.

## Deliverables
1. Full-screen camera view with React Native Vision Camera integration
2. Basic mode selector component (Auto/Barcode/OCR)
3. Scanning overlay with visual frame guides
4. Result screen foundation for displaying license data
5. Basic state management for scanning flow

## Dependencies
- M02 and M03 completion (PDF417 scanning and OCR modules)
- React Native Vision Camera setup from S02
- DLParser-Swift integration from S01

## Tasks
- [x] T01_S06 - Camera View Component Setup
- [x] T02_S06 - Mode Selector Implementation
- [x] T03_S06 - Scanning Overlay Components
- [x] T04_S06 - Result Screen Foundation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Camera preview runs at 30fps consistently
- Mode selector allows switching between Auto/Barcode/OCR
- Visual guides help users position license correctly
- Result screen can display parsed license data
- All components follow React Native best practices

## Architecture Decisions
- TBD - Will be linked after ADR creation

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Camera performance on older devices
  - **Mitigation:** Implement adaptive frame rate based on device capabilities
- **Risk:** UI responsiveness during scanning
  - **Mitigation:** Use React Native's InteractionManager for heavy operations

## Notes
- Focus on core functionality first, polish comes in S07
- Ensure components are testable from the start
- Consider accessibility basics even in this phase
