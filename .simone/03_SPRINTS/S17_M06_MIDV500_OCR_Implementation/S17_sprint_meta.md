# Sprint: Sprint 17 - OCR Enhancement Implementation (S17)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the selected OCR enhancement approach and integrate with existing scanning pipeline while maintaining PDF417 functionality.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Implement selected OCR enhancement solution (Apple Vision or Commercial SDK)
- Integrate OCR enhancement with existing React Native bridge
- Maintain compatibility with current PDF417 scanning functionality
- Implement fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Add configuration options for OCR enhancement enable/disable
- Initial validation against MIDV-500 test suite

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Selected OCR enhancement solution fully implemented and integrated
- React Native bridge updated to support enhanced OCR capabilities
- PDF417 scanning functionality remains unchanged and working
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms implemented
- Configuration system allows enabling/disabling OCR enhancement
- Initial MIDV-500 validation shows improved accuracy over baseline
- Code review completed and unit tests added for new functionality
- Documentation updated for enhanced OCR capabilities

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint implements the core OCR enhancement functionality
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S16 (OCR Enhancement Research must be completed with clear recommendation)
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding enhancement capabilities
