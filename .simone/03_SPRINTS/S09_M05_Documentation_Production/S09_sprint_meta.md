# Sprint S09: Documentation & Production Readiness

## Sprint Goal
Complete all documentation, optimize performance to meet benchmarks, prepare NPM package for release, and ensure production readiness with security audit.

## Deliverables
1. Complete API reference documentation
2. Integration guides (quick start, advanced usage)
3. Performance optimization implementation
4. NPM package configuration and publishing
5. Security audit and vulnerability fixes

## Dependencies
- S08 completion (testing infrastructure)
- All previous sprints stable
- Performance baseline from S08

## Tasks
- [x] T01_S09 - API Documentation & Guides
- [x] T02_S09 - Performance Optimization
- [x] T03_S09 - NPM Package Preparation
- [x] T04_S09 - Security Audit & Hardening

## Acceptance Criteria
- API documentation covers 100% of public methods
- Performance meets all benchmarks (scan time, FPS, memory)
- NPM package installs cleanly in new projects
- Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Example app demonstrates all features

## Architecture Decisions
- TBD - Will be linked after ADR creation

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Documentation may become outdated
  - **Mitigation:** Generate docs from code comments where possible
- **Risk:** Performance optimization may break functionality
  - **Mitigation:** Run full test suite after each optimization

## Notes
- Use TypeDoc or similar for API documentation
- Include migration guide from other scanning libraries
- Create troubleshooting guide based on common issues
- Prepare community resources (issue templates, etc.)
