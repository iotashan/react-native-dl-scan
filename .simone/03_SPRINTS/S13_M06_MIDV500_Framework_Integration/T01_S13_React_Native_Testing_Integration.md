# Task: React Native Testing Framework Integration

## Description
Integrate testing framework with React Native testing tools (Detox or Appium) to enable automated end-to-end testing within React Native ecosystem. This integration provides seamless automated testing capabilities for React Native components and workflows.

## Goal / Objectives
- Integrate testing framework with React Native testing tools (Detox or Appium)
- Enable automated end-to-end testing for React Native scanning components
- Create testing bridge between MIDV-500 framework and React Native test runner
- Support CI/CD integration for automated test execution
- Provide testing utilities for React Native component validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React Native testing framework (Detox or Appium) successfully integrated
- [ ] Testing bridge connects MIDV-500 framework with React Native test execution
- [ ] Automated test scenarios implemented for core scanning workflows
- [ ] CI/CD integration working for automated test execution
- [ ] Testing utilities support React Native component validation
- [ ] Error handling and test isolation implemented for stability
- [ ] Performance validation ensures testing doesn't impact app performance
- [ ] Documentation covering testing setup and usage patterns

## Subtasks
- [ ] Evaluate and select React Native testing framework (Detox vs Appium)
- [ ] Install and configure chosen testing framework in project
- [ ] Create testing bridge to connect MIDV-500 framework with React Native tests
- [ ] Implement automated test scenarios for core scanning workflows
- [ ] Add React Native component testing utilities and helpers
- [ ] Create test isolation and error handling for reliable execution
- [ ] Integrate testing framework with existing CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add performance validation to ensure testing doesn't impact app performance
- [ ] Create test configuration management for different environments
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution for efficiency
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests validating React Native integration
- [ ] Document testing framework setup and usage patterns

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Testing framework connection with S12 T01 test harness for frame injection
- Component integration with S12 T04 React Native scanning components
- Result validation compatibility with S12 T03 ground truth comparison
- Performance integration with S13 T04 metrics collection system

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Testing patterns from existing React Native test setup in `__tests__/`
- Configuration patterns from existing app environment management
- Component testing approaches from current React Native component tests
- CI/CD integration patterns from existing pipeline configuration

**Implementation Notes:**
- Choose Detox for better React Native integration or Appium for broader device support
- Design testing bridge as optional enhancement that doesn't modify production code
- Create environment-specific test configurations for development vs CI
- Implement test data management for MIDV-500 frame injection
- Plan for both component-level and integration testing scenarios
