# Task: Native iOS Unit Test Integration

## Description
Integrate native iOS unit testing with the MIDV-500 testing framework to enable comprehensive testing of native Swift/Objective-C components. This provides native-level validation and ensures testing coverage across all layers of the application.

## Goal / Objectives
- Integrate native iOS unit tests with MIDV-500 testing framework
- Enable testing of native Swift/Objective-C scanning components
- Create testing utilities for native iOS component validation
- Support both XCTest and third-party testing frameworks
- Provide seamless integration between native and React Native tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Native iOS unit test framework integrated with MIDV-500 testing system
- [ ] XCTest integration working for native component testing
- [ ] Testing utilities support native Swift/Objective-C component validation
- [ ] Seamless integration between native and React Native test execution
- [ ] Native test results integrated with overall testing reporting
- [ ] Performance validation for native component testing efficiency
- [ ] Error handling and test isolation implemented for native tests
- [ ] Documentation covering native iOS testing setup and patterns

## Subtasks
- [ ] Set up XCTest integration with existing native iOS codebase
- [ ] Create testing utilities for native Swift/Objective-C components
- [ ] Implement native test bridge to MIDV-500 testing framework
- [ ] Add native component testing for core scanning functionality
- [ ] Create shared test data management between native and React Native tests
- [ ] Implement test result aggregation from native tests
- [ ] Add performance validation for native testing efficiency
- [ ] Create error handling and test isolation for native test stability
- [ ] Integrate native tests with CI/CD pipeline execution
- [ ] Add mock and stub utilities for native component testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive native tests covering core scanning components
- [ ] Document native iOS testing patterns and best practices

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Native testing integration with S12 T01 test harness for data injection
- Component validation alignment with S12 T04 React Native integration
- Performance metrics compatibility with S13 T04 metrics collection
- Result aggregation integration with S13 T05 reporting system

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Native testing patterns from existing iOS project structure
- XCTest configuration from current native test setup
- Bridging patterns from React Native native module development
- Build configuration patterns from existing iOS app target

**Implementation Notes:**
- Leverage existing XCTest infrastructure and build configuration
- Create minimal bridging code to connect native tests with framework
- Design native tests to run independently but integrate results
- Use shared test data sources for consistency across test layers
- Plan for both unit and integration testing at native level
