# Sprint: Sprint 13 - Framework Integration and Validation (S13)

## Sprint Goal
Integrate testing framework with React Native testing tools (Detox/Appium) and validate functionality across full MIDV-500 dataset.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Integrate with React Native testing framework (Detox/Appium)
- Add native iOS unit test integration
- Implement comprehensive result validation for all 500 videos
- Create performance metrics collection and analysis
- Validate framework works across all document types and conditions
- Optimize testing framework performance for large dataset processing

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- React Native testing integration complete (Detox or Appium)
- Native iOS unit tests integrated with testing framework
- Full MIDV-500 dataset processing validated (all 500 videos)
- Performance metrics collection working (processing time, accuracy, memory usage)
- Framework can handle device variations (iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 data)
- Test results dashboard or reporting system functional
- Memory and performance optimization completed for mobile constraints

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint ensures the testing framework scales to full dataset
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S12 (Core Testing Framework must be completed)
- Critical to validate performance on mobile devices and optimize accordingly
