# Sprint: Sprint 18 - Production Integration and Optimization (S18)

## Sprint Goal
Optimize OCR enhancement for production deployment, complete full MIDV-500 validation, and implement performance optimizations for mobile devices.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Performance optimization for mobile device constraints (memory, battery, processing)
- Complete validation against full MIDV-500 test suite (all 500 videos)
- Implement production-ready error handling and logging
- Add telemetry and analytics for OCR performance monitoring
- Optimize real-time processing performance
- Prepare deployment configuration and rollout strategy

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- OCR enhancement optimized for mobile device performance constraints
- Full MIDV-500 validation completed with documented accuracy improvements (target: 15-20% improvement)
- Production error handling and logging implemented
- Telemetry system working for monitoring OCR performance in production
- Real-time processing maintains acceptable scanning speed
- Deployment strategy documented with rollout plan and rollback procedures
- Performance benchmarks meet mobile device requirements (memory, battery, speed)
- Production readiness checklist completed

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on production readiness and performance optimization
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S17 (OCR Implementation must be completed)
- Critical to validate performance meets mobile device constraints before deployment
