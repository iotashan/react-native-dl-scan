# Sprint: Sprint 29 - Mobile Performance Optimization (S29)

## Sprint Goal
Optimize fraud detection for mobile devices, ensure real-time performance, minimize battery impact, and implement resource-efficient processing.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Performance optimization for real-time fraud detection
- Memory usage optimization to stay under 75MB target
- Battery impact minimization (target <15% increase)
- GPU acceleration implementation for Core ML
- Implement intelligent caching for repeated validations
- Create performance profiling and monitoring tools
- Optimize network usage for model updates

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Total processing time <3 seconds (OCR + fraud detection)
- Fraud detection overhead <500ms on average
- Memory usage staying under 75MB during peak processing
- Battery impact measured at <15% increase over baseline
- GPU acceleration reducing CPU load by >50%
- Caching system reducing repeated processing by >80%
- Performance monitoring integrated with production metrics
- Network optimization reducing update bandwidth by >60%

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on mobile-specific optimizations
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S28 (Enhanced OCR Integration must be completed)
- Critical for production deployment on mobile devices
- Consider various device capabilities and iOS versions
