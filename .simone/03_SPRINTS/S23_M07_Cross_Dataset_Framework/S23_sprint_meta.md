# Sprint: Sprint 23 - Cross-Dataset Integration Framework (S23)

## Sprint Goal
Create unified framework for combining MIDV-500 accuracy validation with IDNet fraud detection, establishing cross-dataset validation capabilities.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Design unified validation API combining both datasets
- Implement cross-dataset feature mapping and alignment
- Create dataset abstraction layer for seamless integration
- Build translation layer between real and synthetic document features
- Establish cross-validation testing methodology
- Implement unified ground truth format for both datasets
- Create performance monitoring for dual-dataset processing

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Unified validation API fully implemented and tested
- Cross-dataset feature mapping completed and validated
- Dataset abstraction layer operational for both MIDV-500 and IDNet
- Translation algorithms achieving >90% feature consistency
- Cross-validation framework producing reliable metrics
- Unified annotation schema documented and implemented
- Performance targets met for combined dataset processing
- Integration tests passing for all cross-dataset scenarios

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint completes Phase 1 foundation work
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S22 (Synthetic Data Processing must be completed)
- Critical for enabling dual-dataset validation approach
- Focus on maintaining modularity for future dataset additions
