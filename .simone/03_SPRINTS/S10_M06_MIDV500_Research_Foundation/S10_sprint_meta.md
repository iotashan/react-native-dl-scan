# Sprint: Sprint 10 - MIDV-500 Research and Foundation (S10)

## Sprint Goal
Research iOS AI SDK capabilities, evaluate commercial OCR options, and analyze MIDV-500 dataset structure to establish foundation for testing framework and OCR enhancement.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Research iOS AI SDK capabilities (Vision framework, Core ML)
- Evaluate commercial OCR SDK options (Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY, Onfido)
- Download and analyze MIDV-500 dataset structure and format
- Document findings and recommendations for OCR enhancement approach
- Establish technical requirements for testing framework

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- iOS AI SDK capabilities documented with specific focus on text detection and document boundary detection
- Commercial OCR SDK evaluation completed with pros/cons analysis
- MIDV-500 dataset downloaded and structure analyzed
- Technical architecture document updated with research findings
- Development environment requirements documented
- Clear recommendation on OCR enhancement approach (Apple Vision vs Commercial SDK vs Custom ML)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint focuses on research and analysis to inform technical decisions for subsequent sprints
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: None
- Risk: Ensure thorough evaluation to avoid rework in later sprints
