# Task: MIDV-500 Dataset Download & Analysis

## Description
Download and analyze the MIDV-500 dataset structure, format, and characteristics to understand the foundation for testing framework development. This task focuses on understanding the dataset without implementing processing infrastructure, establishing the knowledge base for subsequent pipeline development.

## Goal / Objectives
- Download and verify complete MIDV-500 dataset integrity
- Analyze dataset structure, video formats, and metadata organization
- Document ground truth format and coordinate system specifications
- Understand shooting conditions and device variations for testing framework planning
- Create dataset documentation for implementation team reference

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete MIDV-500 dataset downloaded and verified (~10GB, 500 videos)
- [ ] Dataset structure analysis completed with comprehensive format documentation
- [ ] Video format specifications documented (resolution, frame rate, encoding)
- [ ] Ground truth JSON format analyzed with field mappings and coordinate systems
- [ ] Shooting conditions categorized (table, keyboard, hand, partial, clutter)
- [ ] Device variations documented (iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S3) with format differences
- [ ] Sample data analysis completed for representative document types
- [ ] Dataset organization and naming conventions documented

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research MIDV-500 dataset download sources and access requirements
- [ ] Download complete dataset and verify file integrity using checksums
- [ ] Analyze video format specifications and encoding parameters
- [ ] Examine ground truth JSON structure for field mappings and data types
- [ ] Document quadrangle coordinate system and validation requirements
- [ ] Categorize shooting conditions and document quality implications
- [ ] Analyze device-specific format differences and compatibility requirements
- [ ] Study representative samples from each document type category
- [ ] Document file organization structure and naming conventions
- [ ] Create dataset summary report with key characteristics and insights

## Technical Guidance

**Analysis Focus Areas:**
- Video format compatibility for cross-platform processing
- Ground truth data structure for automated testing integration
- Quality variation patterns across shooting conditions
- Device-specific format considerations for mobile testing
- Document type coverage and representative sampling strategies

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Structured dataset overview with technical specifications
- Ground truth format reference with field mappings
- Quality assessment framework for shooting condition variations
- Integration requirements summary for development team planning

**Implementation Notes:**
- Focus on understanding rather than implementation in this task
- Create comprehensive documentation for T07 pipeline development
- Identify potential challenges and edge cases for testing framework
- Document findings in format suitable for technical specification development
