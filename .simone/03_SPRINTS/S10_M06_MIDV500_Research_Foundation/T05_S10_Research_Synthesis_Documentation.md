# Task: Research Synthesis & Recommendations Documentation

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation synthesizing all research findings from the sprint into a coherent technical design document. This deliverable consolidates insights from iOS AI SDK evaluation, commercial OCR analysis, MIDV-500 dataset research, and technical requirements planning into clear recommendations and next steps for the development team and stakeholders.

## Goal / Objectives
- Synthesize all sprint research into comprehensive technical design document
- Provide clear recommendations for OCR enhancement approach selection
- Document testing framework implementation strategy with technical specifications
- Create stakeholder-ready summary of findings and proposed next steps
- Establish knowledge base for future sprint planning and implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive technical design document created synthesizing all research findings
- [ ] Executive summary provided with clear recommendations for stakeholders
- [ ] OCR enhancement approach recommendation with technical justification
- [ ] Testing framework implementation strategy documented with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented for recommended approaches
- [ ] Implementation timeline and resource requirements clearly specified
- [ ] Technical specifications ready for development team sprint planning
- [ ] Knowledge transfer documentation prepared for ongoing project maintenance

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create document structure and outline for comprehensive research synthesis
- [ ] Write executive summary highlighting key findings and recommendations
- [ ] Document iOS AI SDK evaluation results with technical specifications
- [ ] Synthesize commercial OCR SDK analysis with pros/cons matrix
- [ ] Integrate MIDV-500 dataset analysis with testing framework implications
- [ ] Present technical requirements and architectural decisions from T04
- [ ] Create recommendation framework with decision criteria and rationale
- [ ] Develop implementation roadmap with timeline and dependency mapping
- [ ] Document risk assessment and mitigation strategies for each approach
- [ ] Create technical specifications suitable for sprint planning
- [ ] Prepare knowledge transfer materials for team onboarding
- [ ] Review and validate document completeness and accuracy

## Technical Guidance

**Document Structure Requirements:**
- Executive summary (1-2 pages) for stakeholder review
- Technical findings section with detailed analysis from each research area
- Recommendations section with clear decision framework and rationale
- Implementation strategy with architecture diagrams and technical specifications
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Appendices with detailed technical data and supporting materials

**Integration Points:**
- Reference existing project documentation standards and formats
- Align with architectural documentation patterns from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Follow decision record format from existing ADRs for consistency
- Integrate with project milestone tracking and sprint planning processes

**Content Requirements:**
- Clear traceability from research findings to recommendations
- Technical depth sufficient for implementation team planning
- Stakeholder accessibility for business and product management review
- Future maintainability with clear versioning and update procedures

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use markdown format for consistency with project documentation standards
- Include architecture diagrams using Mermaid format for compatibility
- Reference specific ADRs and technical decisions for context
- Provide clear next steps and action items for subsequent sprints
- Establish documentation maintenance procedures for ongoing updates

**Quality Criteria:**
- Technical accuracy validated against research findings
- Stakeholder accessibility tested with non-technical review
- Implementation feasibility confirmed with development team input
- Documentation completeness verified against project standards
