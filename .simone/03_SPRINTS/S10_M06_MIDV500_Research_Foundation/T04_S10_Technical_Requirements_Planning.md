# Task: Technical Requirements & Architecture Planning

## Description
Synthesize findings from iOS AI SDK research, commercial OCR evaluation, and MIDV-500 dataset analysis to establish technical requirements and architectural decisions for testing framework and OCR enhancement. This task integrates research outputs into actionable technical specifications and architectural guidance for subsequent sprint implementation.

## Goal / Objectives
- Synthesize research findings into comprehensive technical requirements
- Define architecture decisions for testing framework integration
- Establish OCR enhancement implementation strategy based on evaluation results
- Document technical constraints and performance requirements
- Create implementation roadmap for subsequent sprints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Technical requirements document created integrating all research findings
- [ ] Testing framework architecture defined with clear integration points
- [ ] OCR enhancement strategy documented with recommended implementation approach
- [ ] Performance requirements established based on research benchmarks
- [ ] Technical constraints and limitations documented for each evaluated option
- [ ] Implementation roadmap created for sprints S11-S19 based on research conclusions
- [ ] Architectural decision records (ADRs) drafted for key technical choices
- [ ] Resource requirements documented for development team planning

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and synthesize iOS AI SDK research findings from T01
- [ ] Analyze commercial OCR SDK evaluation results from T02
- [ ] Integrate MIDV-500 dataset analysis conclusions from T03
- [ ] Define testing framework architectural requirements
- [ ] Establish OCR enhancement implementation strategy
- [ ] Document performance baselines and improvement targets
- [ ] Create technical constraint analysis for each evaluated approach
- [ ] Draft architectural decision records for key technology choices
- [ ] Develop implementation timeline and dependency mapping
- [ ] Define resource requirements and team skill needs
- [ ] Create risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Document integration requirements with existing React Native architecture

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- React Native Vision Camera frame processor architecture compatibility
- JSI-based native module performance requirements and constraints
- iOS testing framework integration with XCTest and Detox automation
- CI/CD pipeline requirements for automated testing infrastructure

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Architectural decision documentation format from existing ADRs
- Technical specification structure from current project documentation
- Performance requirement definition from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Testing strategy patterns from `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

**Synthesis Requirements:**
- Cross-reference findings from T01-T03 for comprehensive analysis
- Identify integration points and potential conflicts between approaches
- Establish priority ranking for OCR enhancement options
- Define clear success criteria for testing framework implementation
- Balance technical capability with implementation complexity and timeline

**Implementation Notes:**
- Consider existing architectural constraints from ADR-001 (React Native Vision Camera)
- Align with parallel processing strategy from ADR-002
- Incorporate error recovery patterns from ADR-003
- Maintain compatibility with current PDF417 scanning implementation
- Ensure scalability for future international document support

**Output Requirements:**
- Technical requirements document suitable for sprint planning
- Architecture diagrams showing integration points and data flow
- Implementation timeline with dependency mapping and risk assessment
- Resource planning guidance for subsequent sprint execution
