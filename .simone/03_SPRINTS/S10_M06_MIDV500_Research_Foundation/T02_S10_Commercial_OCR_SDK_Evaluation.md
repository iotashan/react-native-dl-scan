# Task: Commercial OCR SDK Evaluation Study

## Description
Evaluate leading commercial OCR SDK options (Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY, Onfido) for identity document processing. This research will compare technical capabilities, integration complexity, pricing models, and performance characteristics against iOS native solutions. The evaluation will inform strategic decisions about OCR enhancement approaches and identify potential alternatives to custom ML model development.

## Goal / Objectives
- Evaluate technical capabilities of Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY, and Onfido SDKs
- Assess integration complexity with React Native Vision Camera architecture
- Compare accuracy and performance against iOS Vision framework baseline
- Analyze pricing models and licensing constraints for production deployment
- Document pros/cons analysis for each commercial option

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Technical evaluation completed for all four commercial SDKs (Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY, Onfido)
- [ ] Integration complexity assessed including React Native compatibility
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established using sample license images
- [ ] Pricing analysis completed with production deployment cost projections
- [ ] Feature comparison matrix created highlighting strengths/weaknesses
- [ ] Technical documentation requirements and support quality evaluated
- [ ] Proof-of-concept integration attempted with most promising option
- [ ] Recommendation framework established for SDK selection criteria

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research Anyline SDK capabilities, pricing, and React Native integration options
- [ ] Evaluate Scandit document scanning features and mobile SDK architecture
- [ ] Investigate ABBYY Mobile SDK for identity document processing capabilities
- [ ] Assess Onfido SDK features focused on document verification and OCR
- [ ] Download and test available demo applications for each SDK
- [ ] Analyze integration requirements and dependencies for React Native projects
- [ ] Compare accuracy claims and benchmarks published by each vendor
- [ ] Evaluate licensing models and pricing tiers for different usage volumes
- [ ] Research customer reviews and case studies for identity document use cases
- [ ] Create standardized evaluation criteria for objective comparison
- [ ] Document technical integration challenges and workarounds for each option
- [ ] Synthesize findings into comprehensive SDK comparison report

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- React Native module architecture compatibility assessment
- JSI vs bridge-based integration performance implications
- Frame processor plugin architecture for real-time document processing
- Native dependency management and build system integration

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Native module integration patterns from DLParser-Swift implementation
- Camera integration architecture established with React Native Vision Camera
- Error handling and user feedback mechanisms from current implementation
- Performance optimization strategies for mobile document processing

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Accuracy on US/Canadian driver's licenses (primary use case)
- Real-time processing capability (target: 10+ FPS)
- Memory usage and battery impact for mobile deployment
- Integration complexity and development time estimates
- Documentation quality and developer support resources
- Licensing costs and scalability for production deployment

**Testing Approach:**
- Use standardized test images from existing project fixtures
- Compare output quality against current PDF417 + OCR fallback results
- Measure processing latency and resource utilization
- Evaluate API consistency and error handling robustness

**Stretch Goals:**
- Prototype integration with the most promising SDK option
- Test with MIDV-500 sample images if available during evaluation
- Evaluate international document support capabilities
