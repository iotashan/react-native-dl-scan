# Task: Preliminary Test Case Framework

## Description
Draft preliminary test case framework based on MIDV-500 dataset analysis and research findings to validate testing approach and surface implementation gaps. This task creates representative test scenarios that will guide testing framework development in subsequent sprints while ensuring comprehensive coverage of identity document processing requirements.

## Goal / Objectives
- Draft representative test cases based on MIDV-500 dataset characteristics
- Validate testing approach against real-world document processing scenarios
- Identify implementation gaps and technical requirements for testing framework
- Create test case templates and patterns for systematic coverage
- Establish foundation for automated testing framework development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test case framework structure defined with clear categorization and coverage areas
- [ ] Representative test cases drafted covering key document types and processing scenarios
- [ ] Test data requirements specified based on MIDV-500 dataset analysis
- [ ] Validation criteria established for OCR accuracy and document boundary detection
- [ ] Edge case scenarios identified and documented for comprehensive testing coverage
- [ ] Integration requirements specified for React Native testing framework
- [ ] Performance benchmark test cases defined for real-time processing validation
- [ ] Test automation strategy outlined for CI/CD pipeline integration

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze MIDV-500 dataset to identify representative test scenarios
- [ ] Define test case categorization framework (document types, conditions, edge cases)
- [ ] Draft test cases for standard US/Canadian driver's license processing
- [ ] Create edge case test scenarios (poor lighting, perspective distortion, partial occlusion)
- [ ] Define validation criteria for text extraction accuracy and boundary detection
- [ ] Specify test data requirements and ground truth comparison methods
- [ ] Design performance benchmark test cases for real-time processing validation
- [ ] Document integration requirements for React Native testing framework
- [ ] Create test case templates for systematic coverage and maintainability
- [ ] Identify automation requirements for CI/CD pipeline integration
- [ ] Validate test approach against existing project testing patterns
- [ ] Document test framework architecture and implementation requirements

## Technical Guidance

**Test Case Categories:**
- Standard document processing (clear conditions, proper lighting, full document visibility)
- Environmental variations (lighting conditions, background clutter, camera angles)
- Document quality scenarios (worn documents, partial damage, security features)
- Edge cases (partial occlusion, perspective distortion, multiple documents)
- Performance validation (processing latency, memory usage, battery impact)

**Integration Points:**
- React Native testing framework compatibility (Detox/Appium integration)
- iOS XCTest integration for native Vision framework validation
- Camera API mocking system for react-native-vision-camera testing
- CI/CD pipeline automation requirements and test execution environment

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Test organization structure from current `__tests__/` directory architecture
- Performance testing patterns from `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
- Mock data generation approaches from existing test fixtures
- Error handling and validation patterns from current test suites

**Validation Requirements:**
- OCR accuracy measurement against ground truth data
- Document boundary detection precision validation
- Processing performance benchmarks (latency, memory, battery)
- Integration compatibility with existing React Native architecture
- Error handling robustness for various failure scenarios

**Implementation Notes:**
- Design test cases for parallel execution to optimize CI/CD performance
- Create modular test components for reusability across different document types
- Establish clear separation between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios
- Consider test data privacy and security requirements for identity document processing
- Plan for test framework scalability as additional document types are supported

**Stretch Goals:**
- Implement sample automated test cases using existing testing infrastructure
- Create visual validation tools for test result verification
- Develop test case generation automation based on MIDV-500 dataset patterns
