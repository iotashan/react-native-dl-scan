# Task: iOS AI SDK Research & Capabilities Analysis

## Description
Research and evaluate iOS AI SDK capabilities, specifically focusing on Vision framework and Core ML for document processing and OCR tasks. This task establishes the technical foundation for understanding Apple's native AI capabilities and how they integrate with the existing React Native architecture. The research will inform decisions about OCR enhancement approaches and testing framework requirements.

## Goal / Objectives
- Analyze iOS Vision framework capabilities for text recognition and document detection
- Evaluate Core ML integration potential for custom model deployment
- Assess performance characteristics and hardware acceleration options
- Document compatibility with existing React Native Vision Camera architecture
- Identify technical constraints and optimization opportunities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vision framework text recognition accuracy benchmarked against existing fallback OCR
- [ ] Document boundary detection capabilities evaluated with sample license images
- [ ] Core ML model integration path documented with performance implications
- [ ] Hardware acceleration options (Neural Engine, GPU) assessed for M3 iPad compatibility
- [ ] Integration compatibility with React Native Vision Camera JSI confirmed
- [ ] Technical capabilities matrix created comparing iOS AI SDK features
- [ ] Performance baseline established for real-time processing requirements

## Subtasks
- [ ] Set up iOS project environment for Vision framework testing
- [ ] Implement VNRecognizeTextRequest testing harness with sample license images
- [ ] Benchmark text recognition accuracy against current OCR fallback method
- [ ] Test VNDetectDocumentSegmentationRequest for license boundary detection
- [ ] Evaluate Core ML model loading and inference performance
- [ ] Research Neural Engine utilization patterns for document processing
- [ ] Document Vision framework API integration points with React Native Vision Camera
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept code samples demonstrating key capabilities
- [ ] Measure memory usage and processing latency for real-time scanning scenarios
- [ ] Document findings in structured technical evaluation format

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- React Native Vision Camera frame processors (`useFrameProcessor` worklets)
- JSI-based native module communication for performance-critical operations
- CVPixelBuffer handling and pixel format optimization (YUV vs RGB)
- Threading model for Vision framework requests (background vs main queue)

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Frame processing architecture from current PDF417 implementation
- Error handling patterns established in ADR-003 (Error Recovery Approach)
- Memory management techniques for continuous frame processing
- Parallel processing approach from ADR-002 (Parallel Processing Strategy)

**Testing Approach:**
- Use existing test license images from project `__tests__/fixtures/`
- Follow performance testing patterns from `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
- Leverage iOS unit testing framework established in `ios/LicenseScanner/Tests/`
- Compare results against DLParser-Swift output for validation

**Stretch Goals:**
- Prototype Vision framework integration with one sample license type
- Evaluate iOS 18+ specific enhancements and capabilities
- Test multi-language support for international documents
