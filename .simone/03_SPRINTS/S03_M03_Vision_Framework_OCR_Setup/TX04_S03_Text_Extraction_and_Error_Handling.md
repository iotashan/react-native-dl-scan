# Task: Text Extraction and Error Handling

## Description
Implement the final text extraction workflow that processes quality-assessed license images through VNRecognizeTextRequest, handles extraction errors comprehensively, and creates foundation interfaces for S02's parsing engine integration. This task completes the S01 OCR foundation by combining T01's OCR configuration, T02's document detection, and T03's quality assessment into a unified text extraction pipeline that outputs structured raw text ready for S02's heuristic parsing engine.
