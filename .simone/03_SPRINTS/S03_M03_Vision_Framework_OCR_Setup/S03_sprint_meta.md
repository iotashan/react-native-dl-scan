# Sprint: Vision Framework OCR Setup (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Establish core OCR infrastructure using iOS Vision Framework for text extraction from driver's license images with quality assessment and preprocessing capabilities.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **VNRecognizeTextRequest Configuration:** Optimal settings for license text recognition
- **Document Detection Pipeline:** VNDetectDocumentSegmentationRequest for license boundary detection  
- **Quality Assessment System:** Pre-processing checks for blur, lighting, and orientation
- **Text Extraction Pipeline:** Raw text extraction from processed license images
- **Performance Foundation:** <2 second processing time baseline

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Vision Framework OCR successfully extracts raw text from license images
- Document detection accurately identifies license boundaries  
- Quality assessment pipeline provides reliable scoring (blur, brightness, contrast)
- Image preprocessing improves OCR accuracy on poor quality images
- Performance baseline established for <2 second target
- Integration points prepared for parsing engine (S02)

## Technical Context
Building on M01's camera integration and React Native bridge infrastructure:
- Leverages existing React Native Vision Camera setup
- Extends iOS native module with Vision Framework OCR
- Implements quality-first approach before text recognition
- Establishes foundation for state-specific parsing in S02

## Dependencies
- M01 completed foundation (âœ… satisfied)
- React Native Vision Camera integration from M01
- iOS Vision Framework APIs
- Camera permission handling from M01

## Success Criteria
- Raw text successfully extracted from license images
- Document boundaries accurately detected (90%+ success rate)
- Quality scoring system provides actionable feedback
- Processing pipeline handles various image conditions
- Foundation ready for intelligent field parsing
