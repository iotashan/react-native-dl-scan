# Task: Vision Framework OCR Configuration

## Description
Configure iOS Vision Framework VNRecognizeTextRequest with optimal settings specifically for driver's license text recognition, building on the existing M01 PDF417 scanning infrastructure. This task establishes the foundational OCR capabilities that will serve as fallback when PDF417 barcode scanning fails, extending the existing frame processor architecture to handle text recognition with performance and accuracy optimized for license document formats.

## Goal / Objectives
- Set up VNRecognizeTextRequest with accuracy-optimized parameters for license scanning
- Configure recognition settings that work reliably across different license formats and states
- Establish iOS version compatibility (iOS 15.0+) and comprehensive error handling foundation
- Create reusable OCR configuration that integrates seamlessly with existing frame processor architecture
- Achieve <2 second overall OCR processing time as part of the real-time scanning pipeline
- Build foundation interfaces that will support T02 document detection integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] VNRecognizeTextRequest configured with optimal settings for license text recognition
- [x] OCR processor class follows existing PDF417Detector patterns for consistency
- [x] Integration with existing frame processor plugin system (DlScanFrameProcessorPlugin.mm)
- [x] Error handling follows established ErrorTranslator patterns with OCR-specific error codes
- [x] Performance optimizations implemented (autoreleasepool, memory management, frame quality checks)
- [x] iOS 15.0+ compatibility validation with graceful degradation for older versions
- [x] Unit tests covering OCR configuration and basic text recognition scenarios
- [x] Integration with existing quality check pipeline (blur, brightness, frame size validation)
- [x] Foundation interfaces ready for T02 document detection and field extraction

## Subtasks
- [x] Research and analyze existing Vision Framework usage patterns from PDF417Detector.swift
- [x] Create OCRTextDetector.swift class following established architecture patterns
- [x] Configure VNRecognizeTextRequest with optimized parameters for license text
  - [x] Set recognition level (accurate vs fast) for license document context
  - [x] Configure language support for multi-state license formats
  - [x] Set minimum text height and character spacing for license text
  - [x] Configure custom words/phrases common in driver's licenses
- [x] Implement frame quality validation specific to text recognition
  - [x] Extend existing blur detection for text readability
  - [x] Add contrast validation for text clarity
  - [x] Implement text region detection for focusing OCR processing
- [x] Integrate with existing frame processor plugin architecture
  - [x] Extend DlScanFrameProcessorPlugin.mm to support OCR mode
  - [x] Add OCR-specific error handling to ErrorTranslator.swift
  - [x] Implement frame rate limiting for OCR processing (lower frequency than PDF417)
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - [x] OCR-specific error codes in ScanErrorCode enum
  - [x] User-friendly error messages for OCR failures
  - [x] Performance logging for OCR processing times
- [x] Performance optimization implementation
  - [x] Memory management with autoreleasepool patterns
  - [x] CVPixelBuffer processing optimization for text recognition

  - [x] Comprehensive inline documentation following existing patterns
  - [x] Update ARCHITECTURE.md with OCR component details
  - [x] Add OCR configuration examples and best practices

## Implementation Context

### Current Architecture Integration Points
- **PDF417Detector.swift**: Reference implementation for Vision Framework integration patterns
- **DlScanFrameProcessorPlugin.mm**: Frame processor plugin that needs OCR mode extension
- **ErrorTranslator.swift**: Error handling system requiring OCR-specific error codes
- **Existing quality checks**: Blur, brightness, and frame size validation to extend for text recognition

### Technical Requirements
- **iOS Target**: iOS 15.0+ for VNRecognizeTextRequest advanced features
- **Performance Target**: <2 seconds OCR processing as part of overall scanning pipeline
- **Memory Management**: Follow existing autoreleasepool patterns from PDF417 implementation
- **Frame Processing**: Integrate with existing CVPixelBuffer processing pipeline
- **Error Handling**: Extend established ErrorTranslator patterns for OCR-specific scenarios

### Vision Framework Configuration Research
The VNRecognizeTextRequest should be configured with:
- Recognition level optimized for accuracy over speed (license text is critical)
- Language configuration supporting multi-state license formats
- Custom vocabulary including common license terms and field labels
- Minimum text height settings appropriate for license document scale
- Region of interest optimization for license card dimensions

### Integration with M01 Infrastructure
- Leverage existing frame processor architecture for real-time processing
- Extend current quality validation pipeline with text-specific checks
- Follow established error handling and logging patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing Swift/Objective-C++ bridge patterns
- Use existing processing queue and thread management approaches
