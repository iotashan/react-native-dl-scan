# Sprint: Sprint 15 - CI/CD Integration and Automation (S15)

## Sprint Goal
Integrate automated testing suite with CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous validation against MIDV-500 dataset and prevent regressions.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Set up CI/CD integration for automated MIDV-500 testing
- Configure automated test execution on code changes
- Implement test result reporting and notifications
- Set up performance regression detection and alerting
- Create automated deployment gates based on test results
- Optimize CI/CD compute resources for large dataset processing

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- CI/CD pipeline automatically runs MIDV-500 tests on relevant code changes
- Test results integrated with pull request reviews and merge criteria
- Performance regression detection working with configurable thresholds
- Automated notifications for test failures and performance degradation
- Deployment gates prevent releases that fail MIDV-500 validation
- CI/CD compute resources optimized for cost and performance
- Documentation for CI/CD setup and maintenance procedures

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint ensures continuous quality assurance is embedded in development workflow
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S14 (Automated Testing Suite must be completed)
- Focus on reliable automation that doesn't slow down development velocity unnecessarily
