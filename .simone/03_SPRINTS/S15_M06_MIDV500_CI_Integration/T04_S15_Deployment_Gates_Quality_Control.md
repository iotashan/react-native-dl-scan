# Task: Deployment Gates & Quality Control

## Description
Implement automated deployment gates based on MIDV-500 test results to prevent releases that fail validation or exhibit performance regressions, ensuring quality control in the deployment pipeline.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create deployment gates based on MIDV-500 test results and performance metrics
- Implement quality control checkpoints preventing problematic releases
- Support configurable gate criteria for different deployment environments
- Provide override mechanisms for emergency deployments with proper approval

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deployment gates preventing releases that fail MIDV-500 validation
- [ ] Quality control checkpoints with configurable criteria and thresholds
- [ ] Environment-specific gate configuration for staging and production deployments
- [ ] Emergency override mechanisms with proper approval and documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive gate reporting with failure analysis and resolution guidance

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S15 T02 test result reporting for gate decision making
- Integrate with S15 T03 performance regression detection for quality gates
- Use S14 T04 regression testing framework for validation criteria
- Leverage S14 T05 test analytics for gate threshold configuration
