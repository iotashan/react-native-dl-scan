# Task: CI/CD Optimization & Resource Management

## Description
Optimize CI/CD compute resources and execution efficiency for cost-effective MIDV-500 dataset processing with intelligent resource allocation and caching strategies.

## Goal / Objectives
- Optimize CI/CD compute resources for cost-effective execution
- Implement intelligent resource allocation and scaling strategies
- Create caching mechanisms for dataset and intermediate processing results
- Support execution optimization balancing speed and cost

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI/CD compute resources optimized for cost and performance balance
- [ ] Intelligent resource allocation with dynamic scaling based on workload
- [ ] Caching mechanisms reducing redundant dataset processing and computation
- [ ] Execution optimization strategies balancing testing speed and infrastructure cost
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring and optimization recommendations

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S13 T06 memory and performance optimization techniques
- Integrate with S13 T03 full dataset processing for efficient CI/CD execution
- Use S15 T01 CI/CD pipeline integration for resource management
- Leverage S14 T03 performance benchmarking for optimization guidance
