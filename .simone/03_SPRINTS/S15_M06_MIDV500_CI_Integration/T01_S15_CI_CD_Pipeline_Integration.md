# Task: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

## Description
Integrate automated MIDV-500 testing suite with CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous validation on code changes with optimized execution and resource management.

## Goal / Objectives
- Set up CI/CD integration for automated MIDV-500 testing execution
- Configure selective test execution based on code changes
- Implement optimized resource management for CI/CD compute efficiency
- Support parallel execution and test orchestration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automatically executes MIDV-500 tests on relevant code changes
- [ ] Selective test execution based on affected components and change scope
- [ ] Optimized resource management with cost-effective compute allocation
- [ ] Parallel test execution with efficient orchestration and load balancing
- [ ] Pipeline configuration supporting different test scenarios and environments

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S14 automated testing suite for CI/CD execution
- Integrate with S13 T01 React Native testing framework
- Use S13 T03 full dataset processing for scalable CI/CD execution
- Leverage S14 T04 regression testing for change-based validation
