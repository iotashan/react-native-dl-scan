# Task: Performance Regression Detection & Alerting

## Description
Implement automated performance regression detection and alerting system with configurable thresholds, trend analysis, and immediate notification for performance degradation in CI/CD pipeline.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create automated performance regression detection in CI/CD workflow
- Implement configurable thresholds for performance and accuracy metrics
- Support trend analysis and baseline comparison for regression identification
- Provide immediate alerting for significant performance degradation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated performance regression detection integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configurable thresholds for performance and accuracy regression identification
- [ ] Trend analysis and baseline comparison for regression validation
- [ ] Immediate alerting for significant performance degradation or accuracy loss
- [ ] Historical performance tracking with regression pattern analysis

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S14 T04 regression testing framework
- Integrate with S14 T03 performance benchmarking suite
- Use S13 T04 performance metrics collection for trend analysis
- Leverage S14 T01 OCR accuracy validation for accuracy regression detection
