# Task: Commercial OCR SDK Evaluation

## Description
Evaluate and prototype at least 2 commercial OCR SDKs (Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY, Onfido) with working implementations and MIDV-500 validation to assess accuracy improvements and integration complexity.

## Goal / Objectives
- Evaluate multiple commercial OCR SDKs for document scanning accuracy
- Implement working prototypes for at least 2 commercial SDK options
- Validate commercial OCR performance against MIDV-500 dataset
- Assess integration complexity, licensing costs, and implementation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Evaluation of at least 2 commercial OCR SDKs with detailed analysis
- [ ] Working prototypes implemented for each evaluated SDK
- [ ] MIDV-500 validation comparing commercial OCR against current baseline
- [ ] Integration complexity assessment including licensing and implementation costs
- [ ] Comparative analysis between different commercial SDK approaches

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S10 T02 commercial OCR SDK evaluation research
- Integrate with S14 automated testing suite for validation
- Use S15 CI/CD integration for prototype testing
- Leverage S12 T03 ground truth comparison for accuracy analysis
