# Task: Comparative Analysis & MIDV-500 Validation

## Description
Conduct comprehensive comparative analysis of all OCR enhancement approaches against MIDV-500 baseline with detailed performance metrics, accuracy improvements, and resource usage analysis.

## Goal / Objectives
- Run comprehensive comparative testing of all OCR approaches against MIDV-500
- Analyze accuracy improvements across different document types and conditions
- Measure performance trade-offs including speed, memory usage, and battery impact
- Generate detailed comparison reports with quantitative and qualitative analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive comparative testing completed across all OCR enhancement approaches
- [ ] Detailed accuracy analysis across document types and shooting conditions
- [ ] Performance trade-off analysis including speed, memory, and battery usage
- [ ] Quantitative comparison reports with statistical significance analysis
- [ ] Qualitative assessment of user experience and integration complexity

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S14 T01 OCR accuracy validation suite for comparative testing
- Use S14 T03 performance benchmarking for resource usage analysis
- Leverage S12 T05 shooting condition support for condition-specific validation
- Integrate with S15 automated testing infrastructure for comprehensive analysis
