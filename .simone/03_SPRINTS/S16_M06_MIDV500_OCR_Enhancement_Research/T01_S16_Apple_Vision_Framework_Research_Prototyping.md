# Task: Apple Vision Framework Research & Prototyping

## Description
Research Apple Vision framework capabilities for document OCR and implement working prototype with MIDV-500 validation to assess accuracy improvements and implementation feasibility.

## Goal / Objectives
- Deep dive research into Apple Vision framework document OCR capabilities
- Implement working prototype integrated with existing scanning pipeline
- Validate Apple Vision OCR against MIDV-500 dataset baseline
- Assess performance improvements and resource usage characteristics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive research analysis of Apple Vision framework OCR capabilities
- [ ] Working prototype implementation integrated with scanning pipeline
- [ ] MIDV-500 validation comparing Apple Vision OCR against current baseline
- [ ] Performance analysis including accuracy improvements and resource usage
- [ ] Implementation complexity assessment and integration requirements

## Technical Guidance
- Build on S10 T01 iOS AI SDK research foundation
- Integrate with S14 automated testing suite for validation
- Use S15 CI/CD integration for prototype testing
- Leverage S12 T03 ground truth comparison for accuracy analysis
