# Sprint: Sprint 16 - OCR Enhancement Research and Prototyping (S16)

## Sprint Goal
Research and prototype OCR enhancement approaches using Apple Vision framework and commercial SDKs, with validation against MIDV-500 baseline.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Deep dive into Apple Vision framework capabilities for document OCR
- Prototype Apple Vision framework integration
- Evaluate commercial OCR SDK integration (Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY)
- Run comparative analysis against current OCR fallback using MIDV-500
- Document performance trade-offs and implementation complexity
- Create recommendation for OCR enhancement approach

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Apple Vision framework prototype implemented and tested
- At least 2 commercial OCR SDKs evaluated with working prototypes
- Comparative testing completed against MIDV-500 dataset baseline
- Performance analysis document with accuracy improvements, speed, and resource usage
- Implementation complexity assessment for each approach
- Clear recommendation document with pros/cons for each OCR enhancement option
- Risk assessment for production integration of recommended approach

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint determines the technical direction for OCR improvements
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S15 (CI Integration must be completed to have baseline metrics)
- Critical sprint for making informed technical decisions about OCR enhancement path
