# Task: Basic Pipeline Integration Testing

## Description
Validate the complete data processing pipeline from video extraction through ground truth parsing and storage organization. This task ensures all environment setup components work together effectively and establishes the foundation for S12 testing framework development.

## Goal / Objectives
- Validate end-to-end pipeline from video files to organized test data
- Test integration between ffmpeg extraction, JSON parsing, and storage systems
- Verify data quality and accessibility for testing framework requirements
- Identify and resolve integration issues before S12 framework development
- Establish performance baselines for pipeline processing operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete pipeline testing from original videos to organized test data
- [ ] Integration validation between all T01-T04 components working correctly
- [ ] Data quality verification for extracted frames and parsed metadata
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for pipeline processing times
- [ ] Error handling validation for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Sample test data generated for S12 testing framework development
- [ ] Integration issues identified and resolved
- [ ] Documentation for pipeline operation and troubleshooting procedures

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create end-to-end pipeline test script integrating all T01-T04 components
- [ ] Test pipeline with representative sample of MIDV-500 videos (10-20 videos)
- [ ] Validate data quality for extracted frames (resolution, format, completeness)
- [ ] Verify ground truth parsing accuracy and data structure consistency
- [ ] Test storage organization and retrieval performance
- [ ] Measure processing performance and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Test error handling for various failure scenarios (corrupted files, missing data)
- [ ] Create sample datasets for different document types and shooting conditions
- [ ] Validate pipeline performance under different system load conditions
- [ ] Document integration issues and resolution procedures
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common pipeline problems
- [ ] Prepare sample test data for S12 testing framework development

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Pipeline output format preparation for S12 testing framework input requirements
- Performance baseline establishment for S13 framework integration validation
- Error handling pattern development for S14 automated testing reliability
- Data quality standards for S15 CI/CD integration requirements

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Integration testing approaches from current React Native testing suite
- Performance benchmarking patterns from existing codebase optimization
- Error handling strategies from React Native Vision Camera integration
- Data validation approaches from current scanning pipeline testing

**Implementation Notes:**
- Design comprehensive test scenarios covering all document types and conditions
- Implement automated pipeline monitoring for continuous validation
- Create modular testing components for individual pipeline stage validation
- Plan for both development and CI/CD environment testing requirements
- Establish clear success criteria for pipeline validation

**Testing Scenarios:**
- Complete processing of representative video samples from each document type
- Edge case handling: corrupted videos, missing ground truth data
- Performance testing: batch processing of multiple videos
- Resource utilization: memory and storage usage monitoring
- Cross-platform compatibility: testing on different development environments

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Video processing time: target <30 seconds per video for frame extraction
- Ground truth parsing: target <1 second per JSON file
- Storage organization: target <5 seconds for complete dataset indexing
- End-to-end pipeline: target <60 seconds for complete video processing

**Quality Validation:**
- Frame extraction completeness: verify 30 frames extracted per video
- Ground truth parsing accuracy: validate all required fields parsed correctly
- Storage organization integrity: confirm all data accessible through indexing
- Data consistency: verify frame-to-metadata alignment and referential integrity
