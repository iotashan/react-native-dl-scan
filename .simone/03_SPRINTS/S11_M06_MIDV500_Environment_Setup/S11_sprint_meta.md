# Sprint: Sprint 11 - MIDV-500 Environment Setup (S11)

## Sprint Goal
Set up development environment for MIDV-500 dataset processing, including video processing tools and ground truth parsing capabilities.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Set up development environment for dataset processing
- Install and configure ffmpeg for video frame extraction
- Implement ground truth JSON data parser
- Create basic video processing pipeline infrastructure
- Set up storage and organization system for MIDV-500 data
- Validate dataset integrity and format

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Development environment configured with all required tools (ffmpeg, JSON parsers)
- Video frame extraction working for MIDV-500 video format
- Ground truth JSON parser implemented and tested
- Data storage structure established for extracted frames and metadata
- Documentation for environment setup process
- All 500 MIDV-500 videos validated and accessible
- Basic pipeline can extract frames and parse ground truth for sample videos

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint establishes the foundation for automated testing framework
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S10 (Research Foundation must be completed)
- Focus on robust data processing pipeline that can handle all video formats in dataset
