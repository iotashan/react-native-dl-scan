# Task: Data Organization & Storage System

## Description
Design and implement comprehensive data organization and storage system for processed MIDV-500 dataset, including extracted frames, parsed ground truth data, and metadata. This system provides efficient access patterns for testing framework and development workflows.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create logical data organization structure for extracted frames and metadata
- Implement efficient storage patterns for development and CI/CD access
- Design indexing and search capabilities for rapid data retrieval
- Establish data lifecycle management and cleanup procedures
- Create backup and synchronization systems for team collaboration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hierarchical data organization system implemented for frames and metadata
- [ ] Efficient indexing system for rapid data retrieval by document type, condition, etc.
- [ ] Storage optimization for development workflow performance
- [ ] Data lifecycle management with automated cleanup and archival
- [ ] Backup and synchronization procedures for team data consistency
- [ ] Access control and security measures for sensitive identity document data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting development workflow requirements
- [ ] Documentation for data organization standards and access procedures

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design hierarchical directory structure for organized data access
- [ ] Implement indexing system for fast retrieval by document type, shooting condition, device
- [ ] Create data catalog with metadata for each processed video and frame set
- [ ] Implement storage optimization using compression and deduplication where appropriate
- [ ] Add data versioning system for tracking processing pipeline changes
- [ ] Create automated cleanup procedures for temporary and cache files
- [ ] Implement backup and synchronization systems for team collaboration
- [ ] Add access control measures for security and privacy compliance
- [ ] Create data integrity monitoring and validation systems
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring for storage access patterns
- [ ] Document data organization standards and team access procedures
- [ ] Create migration tools for evolving data organization requirements

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Directory structure compatibility with T02 ffmpeg output requirements
- Index format integration with T03 ground truth parser output
- Access pattern design for T05 pipeline integration testing
- Storage performance requirements for S12 testing framework efficiency

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- File system organization from current `__tests__/fixtures/` structure
- Data management approaches from existing React Native asset handling
- Indexing patterns from current project metadata systems
- Security practices from existing sensitive data handling

**Implementation Notes:**
- Design for both local development and CI/CD environment access
- Implement consistent naming conventions across all data types
- Create modular storage components for different access patterns
- Plan for future data format evolution and migration needs
- Consider cross-platform compatibility for team development environments

**Storage Architecture:**
```
MIDV500_Data/
├── videos/           # Original video files
├── frames/           # Extracted frames organized by video
├── ground_truth/     # Parsed JSON metadata
├── indexes/          # Search and retrieval indexes
├── cache/            # Temporary processing files
└── reports/          # Processing and validation reports
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Sub-second access times for individual frame and metadata retrieval
- Efficient batch access for testing framework operations
- Optimized storage usage without compromising data integrity
- Scalable architecture for future dataset expansion

**Security Considerations:**
- Access control for identity document data protection
- Data encryption for sensitive personal information
- Audit logging for data access and modification tracking
- Compliance with privacy regulations for identity document processing
