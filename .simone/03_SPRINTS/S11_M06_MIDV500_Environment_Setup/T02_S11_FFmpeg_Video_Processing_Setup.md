# Task: FFmpeg Video Processing Setup

## Description
Set up ffmpeg environment and implement video frame extraction pipeline for MIDV-500 dataset processing. This task creates the core video processing infrastructure needed for converting video clips into individual frames for testing framework integration.

## Goal / Objectives
- Install and configure ffmpeg for cross-platform video processing
- Implement frame extraction pipeline with configurable parameters
- Support multiple video formats and resolutions from MIDV-500 dataset
- Optimize extraction performance for large-scale dataset processing
- Create frame extraction tools for development and automation use

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FFmpeg installed and configured for development and CI/CD environments
- [ ] Frame extraction pipeline implemented with configurable sampling rates
- [ ] Support for all video formats present in MIDV-500 dataset
- [ ] Batch processing capability for multiple videos implemented
- [ ] Performance optimization for efficient large-scale processing
- [ ] Quality validation for extracted frames (resolution, format, integrity)
- [ ] Command-line tools created for manual and automated frame extraction
- [ ] Documentation for ffmpeg setup and frame extraction procedures

## Subtasks
- [ ] Install ffmpeg on development machines and document installation procedures
- [ ] Analyze MIDV-500 video formats and encoding parameters
- [ ] Implement frame extraction script with configurable sampling rate (default: 30 frames per video)
- [ ] Add support for different output formats (PNG, JPEG) and quality settings
- [ ] Create batch processing system for multiple video files
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and error handling for extraction operations
- [ ] Add frame quality validation and metadata extraction
- [ ] Create command-line interface for frame extraction operations
- [ ] Test extraction pipeline with representative MIDV-500 video samples
- [ ] Optimize performance for memory efficiency and processing speed
- [ ] Document ffmpeg configuration and usage procedures
- [ ] Create automation scripts for CI/CD environment setup

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Output frame format compatibility with T03 ground truth parser requirements
- File naming conventions alignment with T04 data organization system
- Batch processing integration with T05 pipeline testing framework
- Memory and performance requirements for T01 dataset storage systems

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Video processing patterns from React Native Vision Camera integration
- Batch processing approaches from existing test automation scripts
- Error handling and logging patterns from current codebase
- Performance optimization strategies for mobile-first development

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use ffmpeg CLI rather than bindings for maximum compatibility
- Implement streaming processing to handle large video files efficiently
- Create modular extraction components for different use cases
- Design for both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes
- Plan for CI/CD environment resource constraints

**Technical Specifications:**
- Frame extraction rate: 30 frames per video (configurable)
- Output formats: PNG (lossless) and JPEG (compressed options)
- Resolution preservation: maintain original video resolution
- Metadata preservation: extract timing and quality information
- Error recovery: handle corrupted or incomplete video files gracefully

**Performance Requirements:**
- Memory usage optimization for large video processing
- Parallel processing capability for multiple videos
- Progress reporting for long-running operations
- Resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
