# Task: MIDV-500 Dataset Download & Validation

## Description
Download the complete MIDV-500 dataset and implement comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity and accessibility for automated testing framework development. This task establishes the data foundation for all subsequent testing and OCR enhancement work.

## Goal / Objectives
- Download complete MIDV-500 dataset (500 videos, ~10GB)
- Implement integrity validation for all dataset files
- Establish secure storage and access patterns for development environment
- Document dataset structure and organization for team reference
- Create validation reports for dataset completeness and quality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete MIDV-500 dataset downloaded and verified (500 videos, ground truth JSON files)
- [ ] File integrity validation implemented using checksums/hashes
- [ ] Dataset structure documented with file organization and naming conventions
- [ ] Access patterns established for development and CI/CD environments
- [ ] Validation report generated showing dataset completeness and any issues
- [ ] Storage optimization implemented for development workflow efficiency
- [ ] Documentation created for dataset access and maintenance procedures

## Subtasks
- [ ] Research MIDV-500 dataset access methods and download sources
- [ ] Implement automated download script with progress tracking and resume capability
- [ ] Create file integrity validation using checksums (MD5/SHA-256)
- [ ] Analyze dataset structure and document organization patterns
- [ ] Validate ground truth JSON files format and completeness
- [ ] Implement storage organization system for efficient access
- [ ] Create dataset summary report with statistics and validation results
- [ ] Document access procedures for development team
- [ ] Set up backup and recovery procedures for dataset preservation
- [ ] Test dataset accessibility from different development environments

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- File system organization compatible with T02 ffmpeg processing pipeline
- Ground truth JSON structure preparation for T03 parser implementation
- Storage pattern design for T04 data organization system integration
- Access method establishment for T05 pipeline integration testing

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- Test data organization from current `__tests__/fixtures/` structure
- File system access patterns from existing React Native project
- Validation and error handling approaches from current codebase
- Documentation standards from project `docs/` directory

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use streaming downloads for large files to handle network interruptions
- Implement parallel download capability for multiple files
- Create modular validation components for reuse across different data types
- Design storage structure for easy navigation and programmatic access
- Consider CI/CD environment requirements for automated testing

**Storage Requirements:**
- ~10GB storage space for complete dataset
- Efficient file organization for quick access during development
- Backup strategy for dataset preservation
- Cross-platform compatibility for development team access
