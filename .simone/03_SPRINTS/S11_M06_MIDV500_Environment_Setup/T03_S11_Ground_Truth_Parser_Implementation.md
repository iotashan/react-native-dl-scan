# Task: Ground Truth JSON Parser Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive parser for MIDV-500 ground truth JSON data, including quadrangle coordinates, text field values, and metadata extraction. This parser provides the foundation for automated validation and testing framework development.

## Goal / Objectives
- Parse MIDV-500 ground truth JSON format with full field support
- Extract quadrangle coordinates for document boundary validation
- Parse text field values for OCR accuracy comparison
- Handle UTF-8 encoding and special characters correctly
- Create structured data objects for testing framework integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JSON parser implemented for complete MIDV-500 ground truth format
- [ ] Quadrangle coordinate extraction and validation working
- [ ] Text field parsing with UTF-8 support and special character handling
- [ ] Metadata extraction for shooting conditions and device information
- [ ] Data validation and error handling for malformed JSON files
- [ ] Structured output format suitable for testing framework integration
- [ ] Performance optimization for batch processing of multiple files
- [ ] Unit tests covering all parser functionality and edge cases

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze MIDV-500 ground truth JSON schema and field structure
- [ ] Implement JSON parser with robust error handling and validation
- [ ] Create quadrangle coordinate extraction and normalization functions
- [ ] Implement text field parsing with UTF-8 encoding support
- [ ] Add metadata extraction for shooting conditions and device types
- [ ] Create structured data models for parsed information
- [ ] Implement validation for required fields and data integrity
- [ ] Add support for partial or incomplete ground truth data
- [ ] Create batch processing functions for multiple JSON files
- [ ] Implement caching and performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all parser functionality
- [ ] Document parser API and usage examples

## Technical Guidance

**Key Integration Points:**
- Output data structure compatibility with T04 data organization system
- Coordinate system alignment with T05 pipeline testing framework
- Text field format preparation for S12 testing framework integration
- Performance requirements for large-scale dataset processing

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**
- JSON parsing patterns from existing React Native configuration handling
- Data validation approaches from current AAMVA parser implementation
- Error handling strategies from DLParser-Swift integration
- Unicode and encoding handling from existing text processing

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use streaming JSON parsing for memory efficiency with large files
- Implement comprehensive validation for data integrity checking
- Create clear data models with TypeScript definitions for type safety
- Design for extensibility to handle potential format variations
- Plan for internationalization and various character encodings

**Data Structure Requirements:**
- Quadrangle coordinates: [x1,y1], [x2,y2], [x3,y3], [x4,y4] format
- Text fields: UTF-8 string values with special character preservation
- Metadata: shooting conditions, device type, document type classification
- Validation flags: completeness indicators and quality assessments

**Performance Considerations:**
- Memory-efficient parsing for large JSON files
- Batch processing capability for hundreds of ground truth files
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading for on-demand field access

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of malformed JSON files
- Missing field detection and default value assignment
- Character encoding issue detection and recovery
- Comprehensive error reporting for debugging
