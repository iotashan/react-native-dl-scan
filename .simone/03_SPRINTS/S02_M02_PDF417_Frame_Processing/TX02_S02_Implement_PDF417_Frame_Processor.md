# Task: Implement PDF417 Frame Processor

## Description
Implement the core PDF417 barcode detection functionality using iOS Vision Framework within a React Native Vision Camera frame processor. This task creates the real-time barcode detection pipeline that processes camera frames and extracts PDF417 barcode data for parsing by the existing DLParser integration.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create frame processor plugin that detects PDF417 barcodes in camera frames
- Integrate iOS Vision Framework for native barcode detection
- Process frames efficiently to maintain 30+ FPS performance
- Extract barcode data and pass to existing DLParser for AAMVA parsing
- Implement frame quality validation before processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Frame processor plugin successfully processes camera frames
- [x] PDF417 barcodes detected using Vision Framework APIs
- [x] Barcode data extracted and passed to DLParser integration
- [x] Frame processing maintains 30+ FPS performance
- [x] Quality checks prevent processing of blurry/poor frames
- [x] Detection results properly communicated to React Native layer
- [x] Memory usage remains stable during continuous scanning

## Subtasks
- [x] Create frame processor plugin class in Swift
- [x] Implement Vision Framework PDF417 detection setup
- [x] Add frame quality validation logic
- [x] Connect detection results to existing LicenseParser
- [x] Implement result callback to JavaScript layer
- [x] Add performance monitoring and frame dropping logic
- [x] Test detection accuracy with sample barcodes

## Technical Guidance

**Key interfaces and integration points:**
- Vision Camera frame processor: `FrameProcessorPlugin` protocol
- iOS Vision Framework: `VNDetectBarcodesRequest` with PDF417 symbology
- Existing integration: `LicenseParser.swift` for AAMVA parsing
- Bridge communication: Following pattern in `DlScan.mm`

**Specific imports and module references:**
- `import Vision` for barcode detection
- `import VisionCamera` for frame processor
- `import DLParser` (existing Swift Package)
- Bridge to existing `LicenseParser` and `ErrorTranslator` classes

**Existing patterns to follow:**
- Error handling: Use `ErrorTranslator.swift` pattern for Vision errors
- Data formatting: Follow existing license data structure from `LicenseParser`
- Memory management: Use autoreleasepool pattern for frame processing
- Result communication: Match existing promise resolution pattern

**Error handling approach:**
- No barcode detected: Silent fail, continue processing next frame
- Poor quality frame: Skip processing, don't report error
- Vision Framework errors: Translate using existing error patterns
- Parser failures: Use existing DLParser error handling

## Implementation Notes

**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Create Swift frame processor plugin class
2. Set up VNDetectBarcodesRequest with PDF417 symbology
3. Implement frame quality checks (blur, lighting)
4. Process frames through Vision Framework
5. Extract barcode string data from detection results
6. Pass to existing LicenseParser for AAMVA parsing
7. Return results via frame processor callback

**Key architectural decisions to respect:**
- Process frames asynchronously to avoid blocking camera
- Use concurrent queue for Vision Framework processing
- Implement adaptive frame rate based on processing load
- Maintain separation between detection and parsing logic

**Testing approach:**
- Unit tests for frame quality validation logic
- Integration tests with mock barcode frames
- Performance tests to verify 30+ FPS maintained
- Test with various PDF417 samples from different states
- Memory leak testing during extended scanning sessions

**Performance considerations:**
- Skip frames if previous frame still processing
- Use lower resolution for initial detection pass
- Cache Vision Framework request objects
- Monitor and limit concurrent frame processing
- Implement early exit on high-confidence detection
