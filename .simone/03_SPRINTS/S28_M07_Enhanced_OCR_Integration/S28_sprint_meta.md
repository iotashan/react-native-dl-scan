# Sprint: Sprint 28 - Enhanced OCR and Fraud Detection Integration (S28)

## Sprint Goal
Integrate fraud detection with existing OCR pipeline, implement unified validation API, and ensure seamless dual-mode operation.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Integrate fraud detection as additional OCR validation layer
- Implement unified validation API combining both systems
- Create seamless handoff between OCR and fraud detection
- Add fraud detection to existing automated testing framework
- Ensure backward compatibility with M06 enhancements
- Implement progressive enhancement for fraud detection
- Create fallback mechanisms for system failures

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Fraud detection fully integrated with OCR pipeline
- Unified API providing single interface for all validation
- Handoff between systems achieving <50ms overhead
- Automated tests covering both OCR and fraud scenarios
- Backward compatibility verified with existing implementations
- Progressive enhancement allowing gradual feature adoption
- Fallback mechanisms ensuring graceful degradation
- Integration tests passing for all combined scenarios

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- This sprint begins Phase 3 production integration
- Timeline: 1 week
- Dependencies: S27 (Real-World Validation must be completed)
- Focus on seamless integration without disrupting existing functionality
- Maintain performance targets from M06
