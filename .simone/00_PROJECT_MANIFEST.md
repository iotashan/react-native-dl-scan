# Project Manifest: React Native DL Scan

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PROCESS UPDATE (2025-06-25)

**T005 FAILED CATASTROPHICALLY** - Attempted "big bang" refactoring without incremental validation resulted in test infrastructure degradation from 62.6% to ~40% pass rate. 

**NEW MANDATORY PROCESS**: All architecture changes MUST follow [INCREMENTAL_REFACTORING_PROCESS.md](01_PROJECT_DOCS/INCREMENTAL_REFACTORING_PROCESS.md)

**KEY REQUIREMENTS**:
1. Extract ONE component at a time with full test validation between each
2. NEVER commit if test pass rate drops (no --no-verify)
3. Update mocks alongside EVERY architecture change
4. Establish rollback plan before starting

**SPRINTS WITHOUT TASKS** (S21-S31): When creating tasks for these sprints, include incremental validation checkpoints for any refactoring work.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**React Native DL Scan** is a high-performance React Native module for scanning US & Canadian driver's licenses. The module provides dual-mode scanning capabilities:

- **Primary:** PDF417 barcode scanning (back of license) with DLParser-Swift for AAMVA compliance
- **Fallback:** Front-side OCR using iOS Vision Framework for AI-powered field extraction

**Key Differentiators:**
- Leverages battle-tested DLParser-Swift library (eliminates 800+ lines of custom AAMVA parsing)
- On-device AI processing for privacy and performance
- Comprehensive error handling and user guidance
- Production-ready architecture with extensive testing strategy

This project follows a milestone-based development approach.
