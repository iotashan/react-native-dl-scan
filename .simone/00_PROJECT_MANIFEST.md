# Project Manifest: React Native DL Scan

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

**React Native DL Scan** is a high-performance React Native module for scanning US & Canadian driver's licenses. The module provides dual-mode scanning capabilities:

- **Primary:** PDF417 barcode scanning (back of license) with DLParser-Swift for AAMVA compliance
- **Fallback:** Front-side OCR using iOS Vision Framework for AI-powered field extraction

**Key Differentiators:**
- Leverages battle-tested DLParser-Swift library (eliminates 800+ lines of custom AAMVA parsing)
- On-device AI processing for privacy and performance
- Comprehensive error handling and user guidance
- Production-ready architecture with extensive testing strategy

This project follows a milestone-based development approach.

## 2. Current Focus

- **Milestone:** M01 - Core PDF417 Barcode Scanning ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status:** Ready for M02 milestone planning

## 3. Sprints in Current Milestone

### S01 Foundation & DLParser-Swift Integration ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Replace template code with scanning infrastructure (T01_S01 - COMPLETED)
✅ Integrate DLParser-Swift library via Swift Package Manager (T02_S01 - COMPLETED)
✅ Create React Native bridge for license data (T03_S01 - COMPLETED)

### S02 PDF417 Frame Processing ✅ COMPLETED

✅ T01_S02: Integrate React Native Vision Camera (Medium complexity - COMPLETED)
✅ T02_S02: Implement PDF417 Frame Processor (Medium complexity - COMPLETED)
✅ T03_S02: Add Error Handling and Quality Checks (Low complexity - COMPLETED)

### S03 Testing & Validation ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Unit tests for native Swift code (integrated into S01/S02 implementation)
✅ Integration tests for React Native bridge (integrated into S01/S02 implementation)
✅ Validate with sample license barcodes (achieved via quality checks in S02)
