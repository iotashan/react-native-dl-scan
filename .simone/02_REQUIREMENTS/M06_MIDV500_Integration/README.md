# Milestone 06: MIDV-500 Dataset Integration

## Overview
Integrate the MIDV-500 dataset (500 video clips of 50 identity document types) to enhance OCR accuracy and establish comprehensive automated testing for identity document scanning.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Enhanced OCR Accuracy**: Leverage iOS AI SDKs with MIDV-500 insights to improve OCR performance on identity documents
2. **Automated Testing**: Implement robust automated testing against MIDV-500 dataset to validate scanning accuracy across diverse document types and conditions

### Secondary Goals
- Establish baseline performance metrics using real-world document variations
- Create framework for continuous quality assurance
- Enable data-driven optimization of scanning algorithms

## Expert Consultation Summary

### Key Findings from AI Consensus
Based on consultation with multiple AI experts, the following critical insights emerged:

**OCR Enhancement Approach:**
- MIDV-500 is a dataset, not pre-trained models - finding ready-to-use models is unlikely
- Custom ML model training requires 6-12+ months with significant ML expertise
- Commercial OCR SDKs (Anyline, Scandit, ABBYY, Onfido) may be more efficient than custom training
- Apple's Vision framework provides optimized on-device OCR capabilities

**Automated Testing:**
- Highly feasible and provides immediate value
- Should be prioritized over custom ML model development
- Real-world dataset testing is superior to synthetic data
- Essential for preventing regressions during OCR improvements

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Start with automated testing framework using MIDV-500
- Evaluate commercial OCR SDKs vs. Apple Vision framework
- Use MIDV-500 for validation/fine-tuning rather than from-scratch training
- Phased approach: testing first, then OCR improvements

## Success Criteria

### Testing Framework
- [ ] Automated testing runs against all 500 MIDV-500 videos
- [ ] Accurate ground truth comparison for text fields and document boundaries
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarking dashboard

### OCR Enhancement
- [ ] Measurable improvement in OCR accuracy on MIDV-500 dataset
- [ ] Maintained or improved performance on existing PDF417 scanning
- [ ] Real-time processing capability on mobile devices
- [ ] Robust error handling for various document conditions

## Technical Considerations

### Dataset Integration
- **Video Processing**: Use ffmpeg for frame extraction (30 frames per video)
- **Ground Truth Format**: Parse quadrangle coordinates and UTF-8 field values
- **Test Conditions**: Handle 5 shooting conditions (table, keyboard, hand, partial, clutter)
- **Device Variations**: Support data from iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S3

### Performance Requirements
- **Real-time Processing**: Maintain current scanning speed
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimize for mobile device constraints
- **Battery Impact**: Minimize power consumption
- **Accuracy Targets**: Improve OCR accuracy by 15-20% over current fallback

### Risk Mitigation
- **Commercial SDK Backup**: If custom ML training proves too complex
- **Phased Rollout**: Test framework first, OCR improvements second
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Maintain existing PDF417 + OCR fallback
- **Resource Management**: Set clear timelines to prevent scope creep

## Resources Required

### Development
- iOS developer with Core ML/Vision framework experience
- React Native developer for testing framework integration
- DevOps support for CI/CD integration

### Infrastructure
- MIDV-500 dataset download and storage (~10GB)
- CI/CD compute resources for automated testing
- Device testing lab for validation

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 12 weeks
- **Phase 1 (Testing)**: 7 weeks
- **Phase 2 (OCR Enhancement)**: 5 weeks
- **Milestone Completion**: Q2 2025
