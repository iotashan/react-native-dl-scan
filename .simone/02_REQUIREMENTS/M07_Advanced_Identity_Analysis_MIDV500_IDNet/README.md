3. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Extend automated testing to cover both accuracy (MIDV-500) and security (IDNet) dimensions
4. **Privacy-Safe Development**: Leverage synthetic data for fraud detection training without privacy concerns

### Secondary Goals
- Establish multi-layered validation pipeline combining OCR accuracy with fraud detection
- Create reusable framework for future security enhancements
- Enable continuous learning from both real and synthetic datasets
- Build confidence scoring system combining multiple validation signals
