# T005 Test Infrastructure Failure Analysis

**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Analysis of**: Test suite execution baseline for Critical Blocker Resolution  
**Overall Results**: 141 failed, 235 passed, 377 total (62.6% pass rate)

## Executive Summary

Test infrastructure is severely compromised with a 62.6% pass rate, confirming the critical blocker identified in T005. The failures fall into distinct categories that require systematic repair as outlined in the T005 implementation plan.

## Test Results Summary

```
Test Suites: 24 failed, 10 passed, 34 total
Tests:       141 failed, 1 skipped, 235 passed, 377 total
Time:        13.84 s
```

**Key Issues Identified**:
1. Mock layer inconsistencies (bridge communication completely broken)
2. Frame processor integration failures 
3. Quality metrics precision issues
4. Performance test infrastructure problems

## Failure Categories Analysis

### 1. Bridge Communication Integration (CRITICAL - Complete Failure)
**File**: `src/__tests__/bridge-communication-integration.test.ts`  
**Status**: 26/28 tests failing (~93% failure rate)

**Root Cause**: Native module mocks are not properly configured
- `mockNativeModule.scanLicense` never called (0 calls expected multiple)
- `mockNativeModule.parseOCRText` never called (0 calls expected multiple)
- Promise handling completely broken (returns `undefined` instead of promises)

**Impact**: Critical - affects core scanning functionality

**Example Failures**:
```
● should handle scanLicense bridge communication correctly
  expect(jest.fn()).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...expected)
  Expected: "@ANSI 636014080000DAQ D1234567..."
  Number of calls: 0
```

### 2. Frame Processor Integration (HIGH - Mock Setup Issues)
**File**: `src/__tests__/frame-processor-integration.test.ts`  
**Status**: 6/13 tests failing (~46% failure rate)

**Root Cause**: Frame processor mock plugin not properly integrated
- `mockPlugin.call` never invoked during frame processing
- Error handling expectations don't match actual behavior
- Frame validation logic bypassed in mocks

**Impact**: High - affects real-time scanning performance validation

### 3. Quality Metrics Precision (MEDIUM - Calculation Issues) 
**File**: `src/frameProcessors/__tests__/qualityMetrics.test.ts`  
**Status**: 2/16 tests failing (~13% failure rate)

**Root Cause**: Floating point precision and status mapping inconsistencies
- Expected `0.72` but received `0.7200000000000001`
- Status mapping: expected `"warning"` but received `"poor"`

**Impact**: Medium - affects quality assessment accuracy

### 4. Performance Testing Infrastructure (HIGH - Missing Setup)
**File**: `src/__tests__/QualityIndicatorPerformance.test.ts`  
**Status**: 3/6 tests failing (50% failure rate)

**Root Cause**: Performance metrics collection undefined
- `ReferenceError: metrics is not defined`
- Performance monitoring infrastructure not properly mocked

**Impact**: High - prevents performance regression detection

### 5. FallbackController Tests (CRITICAL - Architecture Issues)
**File**: `src/utils/__tests__/FallbackController.test.ts`  
**Status**: Multiple failures indicating over-complexity

**Root Cause**: Monolithic 978-line FallbackController class
- Complex state management making tests brittle
- Too many responsibilities in single class
- Difficult to mock and test in isolation

**Impact**: Critical - validates T005 architecture simplification need

## Mock Infrastructure Issues

### React Native Vision Camera Mocks
- Inconsistent frame processor plugin setup
- Missing worklet runtime configuration  
- Frame object structure mismatches

### Native Module Mocks
- Bridge communication completely non-functional
- Method call tracking not working
- Promise/callback handling broken

### Jest Configuration Issues
- Setup files may have conflicting mock patterns
- Possible timing issues with async operations
- Memory leaks suggested by force exit message

## Recommended Repair Strategy (Aligns with T005 Plan)

### Phase 2A: Mock Standardization (Priority 1)
1. **Consolidate React Native Vision Camera mocks** - Single consistent pattern
2. **Fix bridge communication mock layer** - Ensure proper method call tracking
3. **Standardize Jest setup** - Remove conflicts between test suites
4. **Validate mock behavior** - Ensure realistic simulation

### Phase 2B: Architecture Simplification (Priority 1 - Parallel)
1. **Extract FallbackController complexity** - Break into 4 focused classes as planned
2. **Simplify test surface area** - Smaller classes easier to test
3. **Remove over-engineered performance monitoring** - Eliminate premature optimization

### Phase 3: Integration Repair (Priority 2)
1. **Fix frame processor integration** - Correct plugin call expectations  
2. **Repair bridge communication tests** - End-to-end integration validation
3. **Address timing and async issues** - Proper test cleanup

## Success Metrics for T005

- **Target**: >90% pass rate (from current 62.6%)
- **Bridge Communication**: 0 → >85% pass rate
- **Frame Processing**: 54% → >85% pass rate  
- **Performance Tests**: 50% → >90% pass rate
- **Overall Suite**: Stable, fast execution without memory leaks

## Technical Dependencies for Repair

1. **Mock Standardization**: No dependencies, can start immediately
2. **Architecture Simplification**: Can proceed parallel to mock work
3. **Integration Validation**: Depends on completion of both streams

## Next Steps (Per T005 Implementation Plan)

1. ✅ **Baseline Complete** - This analysis document created
2. 🔄 **Begin Phase 2** - Parallel mock standardization and architecture work  
3. 📋 **Phase 3** - Integration testing once infrastructure repaired
