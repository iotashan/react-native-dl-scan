# Future International Support Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines potential future considerations for international license support. **Note**: These are advanced features for future development - the current scope focuses on US/Canadian licenses using DLParser-Swift.

## Current Scope: US/Canada Only

Our current implementation using DLParser-Swift provides:
- Complete US license support (all 50 states)
- Canadian license support (all provinces)
- AAMVA standard compliance (versions 1-10)

This covers the vast majority of North American use cases and provides a solid foundation for the initial release.

## Future International Considerations

### Potential Regional Support

If international expansion becomes a priority, consider these regions:

1. **Europe (EU/UK)**
   - ISO/IEC 18013 standard compliance
   - Multiple language support
   - Different barcode formats (QR codes common)

2. **Asia-Pacific**
   - Country-specific standards
   - Different character sets (Japanese, Chinese)
   - Varying document formats

3. **International Driving Permits**
   - Standardized format across countries
   - Machine-readable zone (MRZ) like passports

### Architecture for Future Expansion

When international support becomes needed, consider this pattern:

```typescript
// Future parser factory pattern
interface LicenseParser {
  canParse(data: string): boolean
  parse(data: string): Promise<LicenseData>
  getSupportedRegions(): string[]
}

class ParserFactory {
  private parsers: LicenseParser[] = [
    new DLParserSwift(), // US/Canada
    // Future parsers could be added here
  ]
  
  async parse(data: string): Promise<LicenseData> {
    for (const parser of this.parsers) {
      if (parser.canParse(data)) {
        return await parser.parse(data)
      }
    }
    throw new Error('Unsupported license format')
  }
}
```

### Technical Considerations

1. **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 support for international characters
2. **Date Formats**: Regional date format handling
3. **Field Variations**: Different license field structures
4. **Language Support**: Multi-language UI text

## Decision: Focus on Core Functionality First

**Recommendation**: Postpone international support until core US/Canadian functionality is proven and stable.

**Rationale**:
- DLParser-Swift handles 99% of North American use cases
- International support adds significant complexity
- Better to excel at core functionality first
- Can evaluate demand and specific requirements later

## Resources for Future Reference

- **ISO/IEC 18013**: International standard for driving licenses
- **ICAO 9303**: Machine readable travel documents
- **Regional Standards**: Each region has specific documentation standards

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: US/Canadian licenses with DLParser-Swift
2. **Phase 2 (Future)**: Evaluate user demand for specific regions
3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Implement targeted international support based on demand

This approach ensures we deliver excellent core functionality without over-engineering for hypothetical future requirements.
