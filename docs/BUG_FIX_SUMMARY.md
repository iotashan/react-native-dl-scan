# OCR Normalization Bug Fix Summary

## Bug Description
The OCR normalization function in `OCRFieldParser.swift` was blindly replacing all occurrences of "0" with "O" and "1" with "I" globally. This caused data corruption in license numbers and other fields where these digits are valid and essential.

### Example of Corruption
- License number "D1234567" → "DI234567" (corrupted)
- License number "12345678" → "I234567B" (corrupted)
- Date "01/15/1990" → "OI/I5/I99O" (corrupted)

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Global Character Replacements
Removed the problematic lines from `normalizeOCRText` method:
```swift
// REMOVED: These lines were corrupting data
// normalized = normalized.replacingOccurrences(of: "0", with: "O", options: [], range: nil)
// normalized = normalized.replacingOccurrences(of: "1", with: "I", options: [], range: nil)
```

### 2. Implemented Context-Aware Corrections
Added a new method `applyNameOCRCorrections` that only applies character corrections in name contexts where they are safe:
```swift
private func applyNameOCRCorrections(_ name: String) -> String {
    var corrected = name
    
    // Common OCR errors in names (safe conversions)
    corrected = corrected.replacingOccurrences(of: "0", with: "O")  // 0 → O (e.g., J0HN → JOHN)
    corrected = corrected.replacingOccurrences(of: "1", with: "I")  // 1 → I (e.g., MAR1A → MARIA)
    corrected = corrected.replacingOccurrences(of: "5", with: "S")  // 5 → S (e.g., JE55ICA → JESSICA)
    corrected = corrected.replacingOccurrences(of: "8", with: "B")  // 8 → B (less common but possible)
    
    return corrected
}
```

### 3. Applied Name Corrections Only Where Appropriate
Updated `extractFirstName`, `extractLastName`, and `extractNameUsingPositionalAnalysis` methods to apply OCR corrections only to name fields where digit-to-letter conversions make sense.

## Impact
- License numbers are now preserved correctly
- Dates maintain their numeric values
- Names still benefit from OCR error correction
- The fix follows the principle of context-aware data processing

## Future Improvements
Consider implementing more sophisticated OCR correction strategies:
- Use confidence scores to guide corrections
- Apply different correction rules for different field types
- Implement machine learning-based OCR error correction
- Add validation rules specific to each field type
